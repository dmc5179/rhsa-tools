This could\nallow an attacker to perform a cross-site scripting attack if a victim was\ntricked into connecting to a site and sending a carefully crafted Expect\nheader. (CVE-2006-3918)\nWhile a web browser cannot be forced to send an arbitrary Expect header by\na third-party attacker, it was recently discovered that certain versions of\nthe Flash plugin can manipulate request headers. If users running such\nversions can be persuaded to load a web page with a malicious Flash applet,\na cross-site scripting attack against the server may be possible.\nUsers of Apache should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a\nbackported patch to correct this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
