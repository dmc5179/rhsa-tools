If an unsuccessful attempt to copy kernel\nmemory from source to destination memory locations occurred, the copy\nroutines did not zero the content at the destination memory location. This\ncould allow a local unprivileged user to view potentially sensitive data.\n(CVE-2008-2729, Important)\n* Alexey Dobriyan discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel\nprocess-tracing system call, ptrace. A local unprivileged user could\nuse this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel hang).\n(CVE-2008-2365, Important)\n* Tavis Ormandy discovered a deficiency in the Linux kernel 32-bit and\n64-bit emulation. This could allow a local unprivileged user to prepare and\nrun a specially crafted binary, which would use this deficiency to leak\nuninitialized and potentially sensitive data. (CVE-2008-0598, Important)\n* It was discovered that the Linux kernel handled string operations in the\nopposite way to the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). This could allow a local\nunprivileged user to cause memory corruption. (CVE-2008-1367, Low)\nAs well, these updated packages fix the following bug:\n* On systems with a large number of CPUs (more than 16), multiple\napplications calling the \"times()\" system call may have caused a system\nhang.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain backported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
