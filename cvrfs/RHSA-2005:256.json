A local user\ncould utilize this flaw to gain information, such as the list of symbols\nused by the program. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1453 to this issue.\nThis erratum addresses the following bugs in the GNU C Library:\n- fix stack alignment in IA-32 clone\n- fix double free in globfree\n- fix fnmatch to avoid jumping based on unitialized memory read\n- fix fseekpos after ungetc\n- fix TZ env var handling if the variable ends with + or -\n- avoid depending on values read from unitialized memory in strtold\non certain architectures\n- fix mapping alignment computation in dl-load\n- fix i486+ strncat inline assembly\n- make gethostid/sethostid work on bi-arch platforms\n- fix ppc64 getcontext/swapcontext\n- fix pthread_exit if called after pthread_create, but before the created\nthread actually started\n- fix return values for tgamma (+-0)\n- fix handling of very long lines in /etc/hosts\n- avoid page aliasing of thread stacks on AMD64\n- avoid busy loop in malloc if concurrent with fork\n- allow putenv and setenv in shared library constructors\n- fix restoring of CCR in swapcontext and getcontext on ppc64\n- avoid using sigaction (SIGPIPE, ...) in syslog implementation\nAll users of glibc should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve\nthese issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
