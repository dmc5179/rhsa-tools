If the \"suspend_lo\" or \"suspend_hi\" file on the\nsysfs file system (\"/sys/\") is modified when the disk array is inactive, it\ncould lead to a local denial of service or privilege escalation. Note: By\ndefault, only the root user can write to the files noted above.\n(CVE-2009-2849, Moderate)\nBug fixes:\n* a bug in nlm_lookup_host() could lead to un-reclaimed file system locks,\nresulting in umount failing & NFS service relocation issues for clusters.\n(BZ#517967)\n* a bug in the sky2 driver prevented the phy from being reset properly on\nsome hardware when it hung, preventing a link from coming back up.\n(BZ#517976)\n* disabling MSI-X for qla2xxx also disabled MSI interrupts. (BZ#519782)\n* performance issues with reads when using the qlge driver on PowerPC\nsystems. A system hang could also occur during reboot. (BZ#519783)\n* unreliable time keeping for Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machines.\nThe KVM pvclock code is now used to detect/correct lost ticks. (BZ#520685)\n* /proc/cpuinfo was missing flags for new features in supported processors,\npossibly preventing the operating system & applications from getting the\nbest performance. (BZ#520686)\n* reading/writing with a serial loopback device on a certain IBM system did\nnot work unless booted with \"pnpacpi=off\". (BZ#520905)\n* mlx4_core failed to load on systems with more than 32 CPUs. (BZ#520906)\n* on big-endian platforms, interfaces using the mlx4_en driver & Large\nReceive Offload (LRO) did not handle VLAN traffic properly (a segmentation\nfault in the VLAN stack in the kernel occurred). (BZ#520908)\n* due to a lock being held for a long time, some systems may have\nexperienced \"BUG: soft lockup\" messages under heavy load. (BZ#520919)\n* incorrect APIC timer calibration may have caused a system hang during\nboot, as well as the system time becoming faster or slower. A warning is\nnow provided. (BZ#521238)\n* a Fibre Channel device re-scan via 'echo \"---\" > /sys/class/scsi_host/\nhost[x]/scan' may not complete after hot adding a drive, leading to soft\nlockups (\"BUG: soft lockup detected\"). (BZ#521239)\n* the Broadcom BCM5761 network device could not to be initialized\nproperly; therefore, the associated interface could not obtain an IP\naddress via DHCP or be assigned one manually. (BZ#521241)\n* when a process attempted to read from a page that had first been accessed\nby writing to part of it (via write(2)), the NFS client needed to flush the\nmodified portion of the page out to the server, & then read the entire page\nback in. This flush caused performance issues. (BZ#521244)\n* a kernel panic when using bnx2x devices & LRO in a bridge. A warning is\nnow provided to disable LRO in these situations. (BZ#522636)\n* the scsi_dh_rdac driver was updated to recognize the Sun StorageTek\nFlexline 380. (BZ#523237)\n* in FIPS mode, random number generators are required to not return the\nfirst block of random data they generate, but rather save it to seed the\nrepetition check. This update brings the random number generator into\nconformance. (BZ#523289)\n* an option to disable/enable the use of the first random block is now\nprovided to bring ansi_cprng into compliance with FIPS-140 continuous test\nrequirements. (BZ#523290)\n* running the SAP Linux Certification Suite in a KVM guest caused severe\nSAP kernel errors, causing it to exit. (BZ#524150)\n* attempting to 'online' a CPU for a KVM guest via sysfs caused a system\ncrash. (BZ#524151)\n* when using KVM, pvclock returned bogus wallclock values. (BZ#524152)\n* the clock could go backwards when using the vsyscall infrastructure.\n(BZ#524527)\nSee References for KBase links re BZ#519782 & BZ#520906.\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. Reboot the system for this update to take\neffect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
