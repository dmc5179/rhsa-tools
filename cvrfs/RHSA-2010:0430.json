Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,\nwhich give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability\nfrom the CVE links in the References section.","PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system\n(DBMS). PL/Perl and PL/Tcl allow users to write PostgreSQL functions in the\nPerl and Tcl languages, and are installed in trusted mode by default. In\ntrusted mode, certain operations, such as operating system level access,\nare restricted.\nA flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL enforced permission checks on\nscripts written in PL/Perl. If the PL/Perl procedural language was\nregistered on a particular database, an authenticated database user running\na specially-crafted PL/Perl script could use this flaw to bypass intended\nPL/Perl trusted mode restrictions, allowing them to run arbitrary Perl\nscripts with the privileges of the database server.
