While the original patch corrected the reported overflow,\nMarkus Oberhumer discovered additional ways a stream could trigger an\noverflow.  An attacker could create a carefully crafted compressed stream\nthat would cause an application to crash if the stream is opened by a user.\nAs an example, an attacker could create a malicious PNG image file that\nwould cause a Web browser or mail viewer to crash if the image is viewed.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned\nthe name CAN-2005-1849 to this issue.\nNote that the versions of zlib shipped with Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux 2.1 and 3 are not vulnerable to this issue.\nAll users should update to these errata packages that contain a patch\nfrom Mark Adler that corrects this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
