Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,\nwhich give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability\nfrom the CVE links in the References section.","MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists of\nthe MySQL server daemon (mysqld) and many client programs and libraries.\nIt was found that the MySQL PolyFromWKB() function did not sanity check\nWell-Known Binary (WKB) data. A remote, authenticated attacker could use\nspecially-crafted WKB data to crash mysqld. This issue only caused a\ntemporary denial of service, as mysqld was automatically restarted after\nthe crash. (CVE-2010-3840)\nA flaw was found in the way MySQL processed certain alternating READ\nrequests provided by HANDLER statements. A remote, authenticated attacker\ncould use this flaw to provide such requests, causing mysqld to crash. This\nissue only caused a temporary denial of service, as mysqld was\nautomatically restarted after the crash. (CVE-2010-3681)\nA directory traversal flaw was found in the way MySQL handled the\nparameters of the MySQL COM_FIELD_LIST network protocol command. A remote,\nauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to obtain descriptions of the\nfields of an arbitrary table using a request with a specially-crafted\ntable name. (CVE-2010-1848)\nAll MySQL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this\nupdate, the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
