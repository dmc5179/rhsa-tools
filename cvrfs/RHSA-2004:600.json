The mod_ssl module provides strong\ncryptography for the Apache Web server via the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)\nand Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols.\nA buffer overflow was discovered in the mod_include module.  This flaw\ncould allow a local user who is authorized to create server-side include\n(SSI) files to gain the privileges of a httpd child (user 'apache').  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2004-0940 to this issue.\nThe mod_digest module does not properly verify the nonce of a client\nresponse by using a AuthNonce secret. This could allow a malicious user who\nis able to sniff network traffic to conduct a replay attack against a\nwebsite using Digest protection. Note that mod_digest implements an older\nversion of the MD5 Digest Authentication specification, which is known not\nto work with modern browsers. This issue does not affect mod_auth_digest. \n(CAN-2003-0987).\nAn issue has been discovered in the mod_ssl module when configured to use\nthe \"SSLCipherSuite\" directive in a directory or location context. If a\nparticular location context has been configured to require a specific set\nof cipher suites, then a client is able to access that location using\nany cipher suite allowed by the virtual host configuration.  (CAN-2004-0885). \nSeveral bugs in mod_ssl were also discovered, including:\n- memory leaks in SSL variable handling\n- possible crashes in the dbm and shmht session caches\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 users of the Apache HTTP Server should upgrade\nto these erratum packages, which contains Apache version 1.3.27 with\nbackported patches correcting these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
