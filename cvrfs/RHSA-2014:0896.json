Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,\nwhich give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability\nfrom the CVE links in the References section.","Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit combines popular open source web frameworks\ninto a single solution for Java applications.\nThis release serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit\n2.5.0, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the 2.6.0 Release\nNotes for information on the most significant of these changes, available\nshortly from https://access.redhat.com/documentation/\nThis release also fixes the following security issues:\nIt was discovered that bouncycastle leaked timing information when\ndecrypting TLS/SSL protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites\nwere used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain\ntext from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL server as a padding\noracle. (CVE-2013-1624)\nIt was found that Mojarra JavaServer Faces did not properly escape\nuser-supplied content in certain circumstances. Contents of outputText tags\nand raw EL expressions that immediately follow script or style elements\nwere not escaped. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted URL to\nexecute arbitrary web script in the user's browser. (CVE-2013-5855)\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.5.0 as provided from the Red\nHat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss Web Framework\nKit 2.6.0.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
