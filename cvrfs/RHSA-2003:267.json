This new certificate is needed so that up2date can continue\nto communicate with Red Hat Network after 28 August 2003.  Without this\nupdated certificate, users will see SSL Connection Errors reported by\nup2date or rhn_register.\nAll users must upgrade to these erratum packages in order to continue to\nuse Red Hat Network.  This includes both interactive use of up2date, as\nwell as actions scheduled by the RHN website.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
