Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,\nwhich give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability\nfrom the CVE links in the References section.","The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is a\nremote display protocol used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux for viewing\nvirtualized guests running on the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)\nhypervisor, or on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor.\nThe spice-xpi package provides a plug-in that allows the SPICE client to\nrun from within Mozilla Firefox.\nA race condition was found in the way the SPICE Firefox plug-in and the\nSPICE client communicated. A local attacker could use this flaw to trick\nthe plug-in and the SPICE client into communicating over an\nattacker-controlled socket, possibly gaining access to authentication\ndetails, or resulting in a man-in-the-middle attack on the SPICE\nconnection. (CVE-2010-2792)\nIt was found that the SPICE Firefox plug-in used a predictable name for its\nlog file. A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct a symbolic link\nattack, allowing them to overwrite arbitrary files accessible to the user\nrunning Firefox. (CVE-2010-2794)\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n* a bug prevented users of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5, with all updates\napplied, from running the SPICE Firefox plug-in when using Firefox 3.6.4.\nWith this update, the plug-in works correctly with Firefox 3.6.4 and the\nlatest version in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5, Firefox 3.6.7. (BZ#618244)\n* unused code has been removed during source code refactoring. This also\nresolves a bug in the SPICE Firefox plug-in that caused it to close random\nfile descriptors. (BZ#594006, BZ#619067)\nNote: This update should be installed together with the RHSA-2010:0632\nqspice-client update: https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0632.html\nUsers of spice-xpi should upgrade to this updated package, which contains\nbackported patches to correct these issues. After installing the update,\nFirefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
