It can decode and encode\nmultilingual streams through many coding systems, such as ISO-8859,\nISO-2022, EUC, SJIS Big5, HZ, and Unicode.\nA bug has been found in versions of lv that read a .lv file in the current\nworking directory.  Any user who subsequently runs lv in that directory\nand uses the v (edit) command can be forced to execute an arbitrary program.\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain a\nversion of lv that is patched to read the .lv configuration file only in\nthe user's home directory.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
