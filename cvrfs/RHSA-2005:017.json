A local user could make use of this\nflaw to gain elevated (root) privileges. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1235 to\nthis issue.\niSEC Security Research discovered a flaw in the page fault handler code\nthat could lead to local users gaining elevated (root) privileges on\nmultiprocessor machines. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0001 to this issue.\nA flaw was discovered where an executable could cause a VMA overlap leading\nto a crash. On Itanium systems, a local user could trigger this flaw by\ncreating a carefully crafted ELF binary. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0003 to\nthis issue.\niSEC Security Research and Georgi Guninski independently discovered a flaw\nin the scm_send function in the auxiliary message layer.  A local user\ncould create a carefully crafted auxiliary message which could cause a\ndenial of service (system hang).  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1016 to this issue.\nKirill Korotaev found a flaw in load_elf_binary affecting kernels prior to\n2.4.26.  A local user could create a carefully crafted binary in such a\nway that it would cause a denial of service (system crash).  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the\nname CAN-2004-1234 to this issue.\nThese packages also fix issues in the io_edgeport driver (CAN-2004-1017), a\nmemory leak in ip_options_get (CAN-2004-1335), and missing VM_IO\nflags in some drivers (CAN-2004-1057).\nOlaf Kirch discovered that the recent security fixes for cmsg_len handling\n(CAN-2004-1016) broke 32-bit compatibility on 64-bit platforms. A patch to\ncorrect this issue is included.\nA recent Internet Draft by Fernando Gont recommended that ICMP Source\nQuench messages be ignored by hosts. A patch to ignore these messages is\nincluded.\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 users running Itanium are advised to\nupgrade their kernels to the packages listed in this erratum.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
