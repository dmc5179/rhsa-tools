Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,\nwhich give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability\nfrom the CVE links in the References section.","The RPM Package Manager (RPM) is a command line driven package management\nsystem capable of installing, uninstalling, verifying, querying, and\nupdating software packages.\nIt was discovered that RPM did not remove setuid and setgid bits set on\nbinaries when upgrading or removing packages. A local attacker able to\ncreate hard links to binaries could use this flaw to keep those binaries on\nthe system, at a specific version level and with the setuid or setgid bit\nset, even if the package providing them was upgraded or removed by a system\nadministrator. This could have security implications if a package was\nupgraded or removed because of a security flaw in a setuid or setgid\nprogram. (CVE-2005-4889, CVE-2010-2059)\nAll users of rpm are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
