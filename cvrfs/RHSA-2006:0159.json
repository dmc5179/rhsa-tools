The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the\nname CVE-2005-2970 to this issue.  This vulnerability only affects users\nwho are using the non-default worker MPM.\nA flaw in mod_imap when using the Referer directive with image maps was\ndiscovered.  With certain site configurations, a remote attacker could\nperform a cross-site scripting attack if a victim can be forced to visit a\nmalicious URL using certain web browsers.  (CVE-2005-3352)\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw in mod_ssl was discovered affecting server\nconfigurations where an SSL virtual host is configured with access control\nand a custom 400 error document.  A remote attacker could send a carefully\ncrafted request to trigger this issue which would lead to a crash.  This\ncrash would only be a denial of service if using the non-default worker\nMPM.  (CVE-2005-3357)\nUsers of httpd should update to these erratum packages which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues along with some additional bugs.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
