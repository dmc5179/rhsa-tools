These\npackages include the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and\nserver.\nA Red Hat specific patch used in the openssh packages as shipped in Red\nHat Enterprise Linux 5.4 (RHSA-2009:1287) loosened certain ownership\nrequirements for directories used as arguments for the ChrootDirectory\nconfiguration options. A malicious user that also has or previously had\nnon-chroot shell access to a system could possibly use this flaw to\nescalate their privileges and run commands as any system user.\n(CVE-2009-2904)\nAll OpenSSH users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing this\nupdate, the OpenSSH server daemon (sshd) will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
