In this release, the installation of vdsm-hooks is not mandatory for the Red Hat Virtualization Host. (BZ#1976095)\n* Previously, rhsmcertd was not enabled by default on the Red Hat Virtualization Host. As a result, the systems did not regularly report to RHSM while the subscription-manager reported no obvious issues and repositories were properly enabled.\nIn this release, rhsmcertd is enabled by default in RHVH, and as a result, RHSM now receives reports regularly. (BZ#1958145)\n* In this release, the Red Hat Virtualization Host has been rebased on top of the RHEL 8.4.0 Batch #1 update. For more information, see the RHEL release notes. (BZ#1957242)\n* Red Hat Virtualization Host now includes an updated scap-security-guide-rhv which allows you to apply a PCI DSS security profile to the system during installation, (BZ#1883793)","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
