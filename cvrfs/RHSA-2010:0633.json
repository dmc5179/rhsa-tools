A privileged guest user could use this flaw to cause the host to\ndereference an invalid pointer, causing the guest to crash (denial of\nservice) or, possibly, resulting in the privileged guest user escalating\ntheir privileges on the host. (CVE-2010-0428)\nIt was found that the libspice component of QEMU-KVM on the host could be\nforced to perform certain memory management operations on memory addresses\ncontrolled by a guest. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash\nthe guest (denial of service) or, possibly, escalate their privileges on\nthe host. (CVE-2010-0429)\nAll qspice users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
