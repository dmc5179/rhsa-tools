This is the\nfourth regular update.\nThis update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.","The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\nThese updated packages fix the following security issues:\n* it was discovered that, when executing a new process, the clear_child_tid\npointer in the Linux kernel is not cleared. If this pointer points to a\nwritable portion of the memory of the new program, the kernel could corrupt\nfour bytes of memory, possibly leading to a local denial of service or\nprivilege escalation. (CVE-2009-2848, Important)\n* a flaw was found in the way the do_sigaltstack() function in the Linux\nkernel copies the stack_t structure to user-space. On 64-bit machines, this\nflaw could lead to a four-byte information leak. (CVE-2009-2847, Moderate)\n* a flaw was found in the ext4 file system code. A local attacker could use\nthis flaw to cause a denial of service by performing a resize operation on\na specially-crafted ext4 file system. (CVE-2009-0745, Low)\n* multiple flaws were found in the ext4 file system code. A local attacker\ncould use these flaws to cause a denial of service by mounting a\nspecially-crafted ext4 file system. (CVE-2009-0746, CVE-2009-0747,\nCVE-2009-0748, Low)\nThese updated packages also include several hundred bug fixes for and\nenhancements to the Linux kernel. Space precludes documenting each of these\nchanges in this advisory and users are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux 5.4 Release Notes for information on the most significant of these\nchanges:\nhttp://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/5.4/html/Release_Notes/\nAlso, for details concerning every bug fixed in and every enhancement added\nto the kernel for this release, see the kernel chapter in the Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 5.4 Technical Notes:\nhttp://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/5.4/html/Technical_Notes/kernel.html\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 users are advised to install these updated\npackages, which address these vulnerabilities as well as fixing the bugs\nand adding the enhancements noted in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.4\nRelease Notes and Technical Notes. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
