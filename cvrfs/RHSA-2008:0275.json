This could allow a local\nunprivileged user to cause a denial of service (kernel crash).\n(CVE-2008-1615, Important)\n* on 64-bit architectures, the possibility of a timer-expiration value\noverflow was found in the Linux kernel high-resolution timers\nfunctionality, hrtimer. This could allow a local unprivileged user to setup\na large interval value, forcing the timer expiry value to become negative,\ncausing a denial of service (kernel hang). (CVE-2007-6712, Important)\n* the possibility of a kernel crash was found in the Linux kernel IPsec\nprotocol implementation, due to improper handling of fragmented ESP\npackets. When an attacker controlling an intermediate router fragmented\nthese packets into very small pieces, it would cause a kernel crash on the\nreceiving node during packet reassembly. (CVE-2007-6282, Important)\n* a potential denial of service attack was discovered in the Linux kernel\nPWC USB video driver. A local unprivileged user could use this flaw to\nbring the kernel USB subsystem into the busy-waiting state, causing a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2007-5093, Low)\nAs well, these updated packages fix the following bugs:\n* in certain situations, a kernel hang and a possible panic occurred when\ndisabling the cpufreq daemon. This may have prevented system reboots from\ncompleting successfully.\n* continual \"softlockup\" messages, which occurred on the guest's console\nafter a successful save and restore of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5\npara-virtualized guest, have been resolved.\n* in the previous kernel packages, the kernel may not have reclaimed NFS\nlocks after a system reboot.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5 users are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain backported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
