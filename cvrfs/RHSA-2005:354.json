TeX takes\na text file and a set of formatting commands as input and creates a\ntypesetter-independent .dvi (DeVice Independent) file as output.\nA number of security flaws have been found affecting libraries used\ninternally within teTeX.  An attacker who has the ability to trick a user\ninto processing a malicious file with teTeX could cause teTeX to crash or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. \nA number of integer overflow bugs that affect Xpdf were discovered. The\nteTeX package contains a copy of the Xpdf code used for parsing PDF files\nand is therefore affected by these bugs. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CAN-2004-0888 and\nCAN-2004-1125 to these issues.\nA number of integer overflow bugs that affect libtiff were discovered.  The\nteTeX package contains an internal copy of libtiff used for parsing TIFF\nimage files and is therefore affected by these bugs.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the\nnames CAN-2004-0803, CAN-2004-0804 and CAN-2004-0886 to these issues.\nAlso latex2html is added to package tetex-latex for 64bit platforms.\nUsers of teTeX should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches and are not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
