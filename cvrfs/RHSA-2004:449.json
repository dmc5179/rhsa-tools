An\nattacker could send a carefully crafted UDP packet to the IPP port which\ncould cause CUPS to stop listening to the port and result in a denial of\nservice.  In order to exploit this bug, an attacker would need to have the\nability to send a UDP packet to the IPP port (by default 631).  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2004-0558 to this issue.\nAll users of cups should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a\nbackported patch as well as a fix for a non-exploitable off-by-one bug.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
