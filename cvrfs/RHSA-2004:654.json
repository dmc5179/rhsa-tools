The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the\nname CAN-2004-1036 to this issue.\nAdditionally, the following issues have been addressed:\n- updated splash screens\n- HIGASHIYAMA Masato's patch to improve Japanese support\n- real 1.4.3a tarball\n- config_local.php and default_pref in /etc/squirrelmail/ to match upstream   \nRPM.\nPlease note that it is possible that upgrading to this package may remove\nyour SquirrelMail configuration files due to a bug in the RPM package. \nUpgrading will prevent this from happening in the future.\nUsers of SquirrelMail are advised to upgrade to this updated package which\ncontains a patched version of SquirrelMail version 1.43a and is not\nvulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
