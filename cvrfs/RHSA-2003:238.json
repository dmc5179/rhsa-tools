This could be used by a local attacker to infer password\nlengths and inter-keystroke timings during password entry.\nCAN-2003-0462: Paul Starzetz discovered a file read race condition existing\nin the execve() system call, which could cause a local crash.\nCAN-2003-0464: A recent change in the RPC code set the reuse flag on\nnewly-created sockets.  Olaf Kirch noticed that his could allow normal\nusers to bind to UDP ports used for services such as nfsd.\nCAN-2003-0476: The execve system call in Linux 2.4.x records the file\ndescriptor of the executable process in the file table of the calling\nprocess, allowing local users to gain read access to restricted file\ndescriptors.  \nCAN-2003-0501: The /proc filesystem in Linux allows local users to obtain\nsensitive information by opening various entries in /proc/self before\nexecuting a setuid program.  This causes the program to fail to change the\nownership and permissions of already opened entries.\nCAN-2003-0550: The STP protocol is known to have no security, which could\nallow attackers to alter the bridge topology.  STP is now turned off by\ndefault.\nCAN-2003-0551: STP input processing was lax in its length checking, which\ncould lead to a denial of service.\nCAN-2003-0552: Jerry Kreuscher discovered that the Forwarding table could\nbe spoofed by sending forged packets with bogus source addresses the same\nas the local host.  \nCAN-2003-0699: The C-Media PCI sound driver in kernel versions prior to\n2.4.21 does not use the get_user function to access userspace, which\ncrosses security boundaries and may facilitate the exploitation of\nvulnerabilities.\nCAN-2003-0700: The C-Media PCI sound driver in kernel versions prior to\n2.4.22 accesses userspace without using the get_user function, which is a\npotential security hole (NOTE: this issue is distinct from that described\nin CAN-2003-0699).\nAll users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which contain\nbackported security patches correcting these vulnerabilities.\nImportant:\nIf you use Red Hat Linux 7.1, you must have installed quota-3.06-9.71 from\nRHSA-2003-187, and if you use Red Hat Linux 7.2 or 7.3, you must have\ninstalled quota-3.06-9.7 from RHSA-2003-187.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
