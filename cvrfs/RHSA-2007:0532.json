A local attacker who has the ability to\nrun scripts on the Apache HTTP Server could manipulate the scoreboard and\ncause arbitrary processes to be terminated, which could lead to a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2007-3304) \nA flaw was found in the Apache HTTP Server mod_status module. Sites with\nthe server-status page publicly accessible and ExtendedStatus enabled were\nvulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux\nthe server-status page is not enabled by default and it is best practice to\nnot make this publicly available. (CVE-2006-5752)\nUsers of Apache should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues. Users should restart Apache\nafter installing this update.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
