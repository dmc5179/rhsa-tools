The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\nhas assigned the name CAN-2005-0667 to this issue.\nUsers of Sylpheed should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a\nbackported patch, and is not vulnerable to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
