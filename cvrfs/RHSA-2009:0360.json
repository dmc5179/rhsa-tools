A local, unprivileged user could\nuse this flaw to deplete kernel memory, eventually leading to a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2009-0031, Important)\n* an off-by-one underflow flaw was found in the eCryptfs subsystem. This\ncould potentially cause a denial of service when the readlink() function\nreturned an error. (CVE-2009-0269, Moderate)\n* a deficiency was found in the Remote BIOS Update (RBU) driver for Dell\nsystems. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to cause a denial of\nservice by reading zero bytes from the image_type or packet_size files in\n\"/sys/devices/platform/dell_rbu/\". (CVE-2009-0322, Moderate)\n* an inverted logic flaw was found in the SysKonnect FDDI PCI adapter\ndriver, allowing driver statistics to be reset only when the CAP_NET_ADMIN\ncapability was absent (local, unprivileged users could reset driver\nstatistics). (CVE-2009-0675, Moderate)\n* the sock_getsockopt() function in the Linux kernel did not properly\ninitialize a data structure that can be directly returned to user-space\nwhen the getsockopt() function is called with SO_BSDCOMPAT optname set.\nThis flaw could possibly lead to memory disclosure.\n(CVE-2009-0676, Moderate)\nThese updated packages also address numerous bugs, including the following:\n* the select() and poll() functions were converted to use high resolution\ntimers (hrtimer). Since the change, the system call pselect7() started\npresenting an incorrect behavior when the specified timeout was NULL.\nInstead of blocking until an event happened (infinite timeout) it was\ntreated as a no timeout (zero seconds). This update fixes the problem.\n(BZ#487382) \n* NFS is a network file system sharing technology commonly used on Linux\nsystems. A bug exists in the Linux kernel implementation of NFS. When two\n(or more) clients have the same file open as it is being written to, a\nfault condition can arise triggering a system crash. This update resolves\nthis bug. (BZ#486645)\n* a bug affected IBM BladeCenter LS21 machines with the High Precision\nEvent Timer (HPET) enabled in the BIOS. In these machines, the HPET_T0_CFG\nregister booted with level-triggered interrupts (HPET_TN_LEVEL) enabled.\nThis resulted in a boot-time hang during the delay calibration. This kernel\nresolves the issue by disabling HPET_TN_LEVEL when setting up periodic\nmode. (BZ#485428)\n* Time Stamp Counter (TSC) is the preferred time source for MRG Realtime\nsystems, although some TSC models do not comply with the requirements of a\nRealtime system. This kernel updates the tests carried out during boot time\nto check the TSC. (BZ#480244)\n* under certain conditions netlink_broadcast may call yield() on behalf of\na high priority kernel thread. This can lead to a system deadlock. The\nissue has been resolved. (BZ#463207)\nOther changes included with this update are noted in the Red Hat Enterprise\nMRG Release Notes, available at the location noted in the References\nsection below.\nAll Red Hat Enterprise MRG users should install this update which addresses\nthese vulnerabilities and fixes these bugs. For this update to take effect,\nthe system must be rebooted.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
