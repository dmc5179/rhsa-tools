A local user could create a program that would cause a core file\nto be dumped into a directory they would not normally have permissions to\nwrite to.  This could lead to a denial of service (disk consumption), or\nallow the local user to gain root privileges.  (CVE-2006-2451)\nPrior to applying this update, users can remove the ability to escalate\nprivileges using this flaw by configuring core files to dump to an absolute\nlocation.  By default, core files are created in the working directory of\nthe faulting application, but this can be overridden by specifying an\nabsolute location for core files in /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern.  To\navoid a potential denial of service, a separate partition for the core\nfiles should be used.\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users are advised to upgrade their kernels\nto the packages associated with their machine architectures and\nconfigurations as listed in this erratum.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
