An attacker could construct a\ncarefully crafted PDF file that could cause CUPS to crash or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code when opened.  This issue was assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0888 by The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org). Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 contained a fix for this issue,\nbut it was found to be incomplete and left 64-bit architectures vulnerable.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2005-0206 to this issue.\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the Gfx::doImage function of Xpdf which\nalso affects the CUPS pdftops filter due to a shared codebase.  An attacker\nwho has the ability to send a malicious PDF file to a printer could\npossibly execute arbitrary code as the \"lp\" user. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-1125 to this issue.\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the ParseCommand function in the\nhpgltops program. An attacker who has the ability to send a malicious HPGL\nfile to a printer could possibly execute arbitrary code as the \"lp\" user.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-1267 to this issue.\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the Decrypt::makeFileKey2 function of\nXpdf which also affects the CUPS pdftops filter due to a shared codebase.\nAn attacker who has the ability to send a malicious PDF file to a printer\ncould possibly execute arbitrary code as the \"lp\" user. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2005-0064 to this issue.\nThe lppasswd utility was found to ignore write errors when modifying the\nCUPS passwd file. A local user who is able to fill the associated file\nsystem could corrupt the CUPS password file or prevent future uses of\nlppasswd. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\nhas assigned the names CAN-2004-1268 and CAN-2004-1269 to these issues.\nThe lppasswd utility was found to not verify that the passwd.new file is\ndifferent from STDERR, which could allow local users to control output to\npasswd.new via certain user input that triggers an error message. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2004-1270 to this issue.\nAll users of cups should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
