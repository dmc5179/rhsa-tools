This erratum\nprovides updated Python packages.\n[updated Feb 12 2003]\nUpdated packages for Red Hat Linux 7.3 are available that fix a binary\nincompatibility change in the original erratum packages that affected\nredhat-config-users, and to add back the missing python-tools package.\n[Updated 16 April 2003]\nAdded packages for Red Hat Linux on IBM iSeries and pSeries systems.","Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming\nlanguage.\nZack Weinberg discovered that os._execvpe from os.py in Python 2.2.1 and\nearlier creates temporary files with predictable names.  This could allow\nlocal users to execute arbitrary code via a symlink attack.\nAll users should upgrade to these errata packages, which contain a patch to\npython 1.5.2 and are not vulnerable to this issue.  Please note that for\nRed Hat Linux 7.3 we have updated the python2 packages from version 2.2 to\nversion 2.2.2.  Red Hat Linux 8.0 shipped a version of Python that already\ncontained a fix for this issue and is therefore not vulnerable to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
