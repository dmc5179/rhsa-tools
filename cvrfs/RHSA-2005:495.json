Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of\nup2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be\ndownloaded directly from the RHN website:\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2005:495"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Low","type":"Impact"}},"acknowledgments":{"acknowledgment":{"description":"Red Hat would like to thank the MIT Kerberos Development Team for their responsible disclosure of this issue."}},"discovery_date":"2004-03-01T00:00:00Z","ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated rsh packages that fix a theoretical security issue are now available.\nThis update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat\nSecurity Response Team","The rsh package contains a set of programs that allow users to run\ncommands on remote machines, login to other machines, and copy files\nbetween machines, using the rsh, rlogin, and rcp commands. All three of\nthese commands use rhosts-style authentication.\nThe rcp protocol allows a server to instruct a client to write to arbitrary\nfiles outside of the current directory.  This could potentially cause a\nsecurity issue if a user uses rcp to copy files from a malicious server. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-0175 to this issue.\nAll users of rsh should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve\nthese issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
