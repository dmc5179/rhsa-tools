An\nattacker could send a list of ciphers to an application that used this\nfunction and overrun a buffer with a single byte (CVE-2007-5135). Few\napplications make use of this vulnerable function and generally it is used\nonly when applications are compiled for debugging. \nA number of possible side-channel attacks were discovered affecting\nOpenSSL. A local attacker could possibly obtain RSA private keys being\nused on a system. In practice these attacks would be difficult to perform\noutside of a lab environment. This update contains backported patches\ndesigned to mitigate these issues.  (CVE-2007-3108).\nUsers of OpenSSL should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues.  \nNote: After installing this update, users are advised to either restart all\nservices that use OpenSSL or restart their system.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
