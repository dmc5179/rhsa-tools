If a library has been found\nin /etc/ld.so.cache this check was not done though, so malicious user\ncould preload some /lib or /usr/lib library before SUID/SGID application\nand e.g. create or overwrite a file he did not have permissions to.\nIn addition to fixing these security bugs, some non-security related bugs\nhave been fixed as well, namely RPC behaviour on unconnected UDP sockets\nwith 2.4 kernels, alphaev6 memcpy bug causing random crashes on alphaev6.\nIn addition, this glibc provides a temporary workaround for a bug in\nIBM JDK 1.1.8.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
