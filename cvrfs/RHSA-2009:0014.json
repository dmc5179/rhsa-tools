This could, potentially, lead to a local denial\nof service. (CVE-2008-5300, Important)\n* when fput() was called to close a socket, the __scm_destroy() function in\nthe Linux kernel could make indirect recursive calls to itself. This could,\npotentially, lead to a local denial of service. (CVE-2008-5029, Important)\n* a deficiency was found in the Linux kernel virtual file system (VFS)\nimplementation. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to make a\nseries of file creations within deleted directories, possibly causing a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2008-3275, Moderate)\n* a buffer underflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel IB700 SBC watchdog\ntimer driver. This deficiency could lead to a possible information leak. By\ndefault, the \"/dev/watchdog\" device is accessible only to the root user.\n(CVE-2008-5702, Low)\n* the hfs and hfsplus file systems code failed to properly handle corrupted\ndata structures. This could, potentially, lead to a local denial of\nservice. (CVE-2008-4933, CVE-2008-5025, Low)\n* a flaw was found in the hfsplus file system implementation. This could,\npotentially, lead to a local denial of service when write operations were\nperformed. (CVE-2008-4934, Low)\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n* when running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.6 and 4.7 on some systems running\nIntel® CPUs, the cpuspeed daemon did not run, preventing the CPU speed from\nbeing changed, such as not being reduced to an idle state when not in use.\n* mmap() could be used to gain access to beyond the first megabyte of RAM,\ndue to insufficient checks in the Linux kernel code. Checks have been added\nto prevent this.\n* attempting to turn keyboard LEDs on and off rapidly on keyboards with\nslow keyboard controllers, may have caused key presses to fail.\n* after migrating a hypervisor guest, the MAC address table was not\nupdated, causing packet loss and preventing network connections to the\nguest. Now, a gratuitous ARP request is sent after migration. This\nrefreshes the ARP caches, minimizing network downtime.\n* writing crash dumps with diskdump may have caused a kernel panic on\nNon-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) systems with certain memory\nconfigurations.\n* on big-endian systems, such as PowerPC, the getsockopt() function\nincorrectly returned 0 depending on the parameters passed to it when the\ntime to live (TTL) value equaled 255, possibly causing memory corruption\nand application crashes.\n* a problem in the kernel packages provided by the RHSA-2008:0508 advisory\ncaused the Linux kernel's built-in memory copy procedure to return the\nwrong error code after recovering from a page fault on AMD64 and Intel 64\nsystems. This may have caused other Linux kernel functions to return wrong\nerror codes.\n* a divide-by-zero bug in the Linux kernel process scheduler, which may\nhave caused kernel panics on certain systems, has been resolved.\n* the netconsole kernel module caused the Linux kernel to hang when slave\ninterfaces of bonded network interfaces were started, resulting in a system\nhang or kernel panic when restarting the network.\n* the \"/proc/xen/\" directory existed even if systems were not running Red\nHat Virtualization. This may have caused problems for third-party software\nthat checks virtualization-ability based on the existence of \"/proc/xen/\".\nNote: this update will remove the \"/proc/xen/\" directory on systems not\nrunning Red Hat Virtualization.\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users should upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain backported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
