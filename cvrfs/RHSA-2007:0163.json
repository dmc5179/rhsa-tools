(CVE-2007-1286) \n- A double-free bug in the \"session\" extension may allow a remote attacker\nto execute arbitrary code as the \"apache\" user, if untrusted input data was\npassed to the session_decode() function . (CVE-2007-1711) \nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
