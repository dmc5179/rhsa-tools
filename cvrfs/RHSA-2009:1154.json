If the DHCP client were to receive a\nmalicious DHCP response, it could crash or execute arbitrary code with the\npermissions of the client (root). (CVE-2009-0692)\nAn insecure temporary file use flaw was discovered in the DHCP daemon's\ninit script (\"/etc/init.d/dhcpd\"). A local attacker could use this flaw to\noverwrite an arbitrary file with the output of the \"dhcpd -t\" command via\na symbolic link attack, if a system administrator executed the DHCP init\nscript with the \"configtest\", \"restart\", or \"reload\" option.\n(CVE-2009-1893)\nUsers of DHCP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
