Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.","The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n* when an application has a stack overflow, the stack could silently\noverwrite another memory mapped area instead of a segmentation fault\noccurring, which could cause an application to execute arbitrary code,\npossibly leading to privilege escalation. It is known that the X Window\nSystem server can be used to trigger this flaw. (CVE-2010-2240, Important)\n* a miscalculation of the size of the free space of the initial directory\nentry in a directory leaf block was found in the Linux kernel Global File\nSystem 2 (GFS2) implementation. A local, unprivileged user with write\naccess to a GFS2-mounted file system could perform a rename operation on\nthat file system to trigger a NULL pointer dereference, possibly resulting\nin a denial of service or privilege escalation. (CVE-2010-2798, Important)\nRed Hat would like to thank the X.Org security team for reporting\nCVE-2010-2240, with upstream acknowledging Rafal Wojtczuk as the original\nreporter; and Grant Diffey of CenITex for reporting CVE-2010-2798.\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n* the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3 General Availability (GA) release\nintroduced a regression in iSCSI failover time. While there was heavy I/O\non the iSCSI layer, attempting to log out of an iSCSI connection at the\nsame time a network problem was occurring, such as a switch dying or a\ncable being pulled out, resulted in iSCSI failover taking several minutes.\nWith this update, failover occurs as expected. (BZ#583898)\n* a bug was found in the way the megaraid_sas driver (for SAS based RAID\ncontrollers) handled physical disks and management IOCTLs. All physical\ndisks were exported to the disk layer, allowing an oops in\nmegasas_complete_cmd_dpc() when completing the IOCTL command if a timeout\noccurred. One possible trigger for this bug was running \"mkfs\". This update\nresolves this issue by updating the megaraid_sas driver to version 4.31.\n(BZ#619362)\n* this update upgrades the bnx2x driver to version 1.52.1-6, and the bnx2x\nfirmware to version 1.52.1-6, incorporating multiple bug fixes and\nenhancements. These fixes include: A race condition on systems using the\nbnx2x driver due to multiqueue being used to transmit data, but only a\nsingle queue transmit ON/OFF scheme being used (only a single queue is\nused with this update); a bug that could have led to a kernel panic when\nusing iSCSI offload; and a bug that caused a firmware crash, causing\nnetwork devices using the bnx2x driver to lose network connectivity. When\nthis firmware crash occurred, errors such as \"timeout polling for state\"\nand \"Stop leading failed!\" were logged. A system reboot was required to\nrestore network connectivity. (BZ#620663, BZ#620668, BZ#620669, BZ#620665)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
