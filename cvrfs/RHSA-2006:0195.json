A malicious user could create a tar archive that could write to\narbitrary files to which the user running GNU tar has write access\n(CVE-2002-0399).  Red Hat included a backported security patch to correct\nthis issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, and an erratum for Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 2.1 users was issued.\nDuring internal testing, we discovered that our backported security patch\ncontained an incorrect optimization and therefore was not sufficient to\ncompletely correct this vulnerability.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned the name CVE-2005-1918 to this\nissue.\nUsers of tar should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a\nreplacement backported patch to correct this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
