FTP is a method of transferring files between\nmachines.\nGlenn Stewart discovered a flaw in wu-ftpd.  When configured with\n\"restricted-gid home\",  an authorized user could use this flaw to\ncircumvent the configured home directory restriction by using chmod.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2004-0148 to this issue.\nMichael Hendrickx found a flaw in the S/Key login handling.  On servers\nusing S/Key authentication, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and\npotentially execute arbitrary code. \nUsers of wu-ftpd are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported security patches and is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
