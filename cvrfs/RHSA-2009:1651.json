A remote attacker could use this flaw to create\nan NTP packet reply loop between two ntpd servers via a malformed packet\nwith a spoofed source IP address and port, causing ntpd on those servers to\nuse excessive amounts of CPU time and fill disk space with log messages.\n(CVE-2009-3563)\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the ntpq diagnostic command. A\nmalicious, remote server could send a specially-crafted reply to an ntpq\nrequest that could crash ntpq or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with\nthe privileges of the user running the ntpq command. (CVE-2009-0159)\nAll ntp users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the\nupdate, the ntpd daemon will restart automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
