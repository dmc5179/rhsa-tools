OpenSSH as distributed with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 contains\nsupport for GSSAPI user authentication, typically used for supporting\nKerberos. On OpenSSH installations which have GSSAPI enabled, this flaw\ncould allow a user who sucessfully authenticates using a method other than\nGSSAPI to be delegated with GSSAPI credentials. The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-2798\nto this issue.\nAdditionally, the following bugs have been addressed:\nThe ssh command incorrectly failed when it was issued by the root user with\na non-default group set.\nThe sshd daemon could fail to properly close the client connection if\nmultiple X clients were forwarded over the connection and the client\nsession exited.\nThe sshd daemon could bind only on the IPv6 address family for X forwarding\nif the port on IPv4 address family was already bound. The X forwarding did\nnot work in such cases.\nThis update also adds support for recording login user IDs for the auditing\nservice. The user ID is attached to the audit records generated from the\nuser's session.\nAll users of openssh should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
