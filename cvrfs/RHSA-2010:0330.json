A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,\nwhich gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in\nthe References section.","The Red Hat Global File System (GFS) allows a cluster of Linux servers to\nshare data in a common pool of storage.\nA flaw was found in the gfs_lock() implementation. The GFS locking code\ncould skip the lock operation for files that have the S_ISGID bit\n(set-group-ID on execution) in their mode set. A local, unprivileged user\non a system that has a GFS file system mounted could use this flaw to cause\na kernel panic. (CVE-2010-0727)\nAs well, these updated GFS packages are in sync with the latest kernel\n(2.4.21-63.EL). The modules in earlier GFS packages fail to load because\nthey do not match the running kernel. It is possible to force-load the\nmodules; however, with this update, force-loading the modules is not\nrequired. (BZ#525198)\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these latest GFS packages, which resolve\nthis issue and are updated for use with the 2.4.21-63.EL kernel.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
