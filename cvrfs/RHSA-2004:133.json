Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of\nup2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be\ndownloaded directly from the RHN website:\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2004:133"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Low","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["An updated squid package is avaliable that fixes a security vulnerability in\nURL decoding and provides a new ACL type for protecting vulnerable clients.","Squid is a full-featured Web proxy cache.\nA bug was found in the processing of %-encoded characters in a URL in\nversions of Squid 2.5.STABLE4 and earlier.  If a Squid configuration uses\nAccess Control Lists (ACLs), a remote attacker could create URLs that would\nnot be correctly tested against Squid's ACLs, potentially allowing clients\nto access prohibited URLs.\nUsers of Squid should update to these erratum packages which are not\nvulnerable to this issue.\nIn addition, these packages contain a new Access Control type, \"urllogin\",\nwhich can be used to protect vulnerable Microsoft Internet Explorer clients\nfrom accessing URLs that contain login information.  Such URLs are often\nused by fraudsters to trick web users into revealing valuable personal data.\nNote that the default Squid configuration does not make use of this new\naccess control type.  You must explicitly configure Squid with ACLs that\nuse this new type, in accordance with your own site policies.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
