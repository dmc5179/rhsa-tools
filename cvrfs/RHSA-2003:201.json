Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003:201"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Moderate","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated ypserv packages fixing a denial of service vulnerability are now\navailable.","The ypserv package contains the Network Information Service (NIS) server.\nA vulnerability has been discovered in the ypserv NIS server prior to\nversion 2.7.  If a malicious client queries ypserv via TCP and subsequently\nignores the server's response, ypserv will block attempting to send the\nreply.  This results in ypserv failing to respond to other client requests.\nVersions 2.7 and above of ypserv have been altered to fork a child for each\nclient request, thus preventing any one request from causing the server to\nblock.\nRed Hat recommends that users of NIS upgrade to these packages, which\ncontain version 2.8.0 of ypserv and are therefore not vulnerable to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
