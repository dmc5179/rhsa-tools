Users with\nselfwrite access were able to modify the distinguished name of any user.\nUsers with selfwrite access should only be able to modify their own\ndistinguished name. (CVE-2006-4600)\nA memory leak bug was found in OpenLDAP's ldap_start_tls_s() function. An\napplication using this function could result in an Out Of Memory (OOM)\ncondition, crashing the application.\nAll users are advised to upgrade to this updated openldap package, \nwhich contains a backported fix and is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
