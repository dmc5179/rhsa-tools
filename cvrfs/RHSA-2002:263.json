Updated packages are available which address this\nvulnerability.\n[Updated 28 August 2003]\nAdded CAN-2003-0461 to the list of security issues that were fixed by this\nadvisory (there are no changes to the packages themselves).","The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.\nA vulnerability in the Linux kernel has been discovered in which a non-root\nuser can cause the machine to freeze. This kernel addresses the\nvulnerability.  \nNote: This bug is specific to the x86 architecture kernels only, and does\nnot affect ia64 or other architectures.\nIn addition, /proc/tty/driver/serial reveals the exact number of\ncharacters used in serial links, which could allow local users to obtain\npotentially sensitive information such as password lengths.\nAll users should upgrade to these errata packages, which are not vulnerable\nto these issues.\nThanks go to Christopher Devine for reporting the vulnerability on Bugtraq,\nand Petr Vandrovec for being the first to supply a fix to the community.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
