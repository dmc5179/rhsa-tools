(CVE-2007-1217, Moderate)\n* a flaw in the Bluetooth subsystem that allowed a local user to trigger an\ninformation leak. (CVE-2007-1353, Low) \nIn addition to the security issues described above, fixes for the following\nhave been included:\n* a race condition in the e1000 network driver that could cause ESB2\nsystems to be started without the RX unit being turned on. \n* a related e1000 bug on ESB2 systems that could cause rlogin to fail.\nRed Hat would like to thank Ilja van Sprundel for reporting an issue fixed\nin this erratum. \nNote: The kernel-unsupported package contains various drivers and modules\nthat are unsupported and therefore might contain security problems that\nhave not been addressed.\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 users are advised to upgrade their kernels\nto the packages associated with their machine architecture and\nconfigurations as listed in this erratum.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
