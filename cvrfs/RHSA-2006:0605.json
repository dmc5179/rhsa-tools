By setting\nan environment variable, a local user could cause sperl to create, as root,\nfiles with arbitrary filenames, or append the debugging information to\nexisting files. (CVE-2005-0155)\nA fix for this issue was first included in the update RHSA-2005:103\nreleased in February 2005.  However the patch to correct this issue was\ndropped from the update RHSA-2005:674 made in October 2005.  This\nregression has been assigned CVE-2006-3813.\nUsers of Perl are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to correct this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
