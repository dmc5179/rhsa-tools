This is\nthe sixth regular update.","The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.\nThis is the sixth regular Itanium kernel update to Red Hat Enterprise Linux\nversion 2.1. This kernel updates several important drivers and fixes a\nnumber of bugs.\nThis update includes fixes for several security issues:\nPaul Starzetz of iSEC discovered various flaws in the ELF binary\nloader affecting kernels prior to 2.4.28. A local user could use these\nflaws to gain read access to executable-only binaries or possibly gain\nprivileges.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CAN-2004-1070, CAN-2004-1071,\nCAN-2004-1072, and CAN-2004-1073 to these issues.\nA missing serialization flaw in unix_dgram_recvmsg was discovered that\naffects kernels prior to 2.4.28. A local user could potentially make\nuse of a race condition in order to gain privileges. (CAN-2004-1068)\nSGI discovered a bug in the elf loader that affects kernels before\n2.4.25 which could be triggered by a malformed binary. On\narchitectures other than x86, a local user could create a malicious\nbinary which could cause a denial of service (crash). (CAN-2004-0136)\nStefan Esser discovered various flaws including buffer overflows in\nthe smbfs driver affecting kernels before 2.4.28. A local user may be\nable to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly gain privileges.\nIn order to exploit these flaws the user would need to have control of\na connected smb server. (CAN-2004-0883, CAN-2004-0949)\nA floating point information leak was discovered in the ia64 architecture\ncontext switch code in kernels before 2.4.27.  A local user could use this\nflaw to read register values of other processes by setting the MFH bit.\n(CAN-2004-0565)\nConectiva discovered flaws in certain USB drivers affecting kernels\nbefore 2.4.27 which used the copy_to_user function on uninitialized\nstructures.  These flaws could allow local users to read small amounts of\nkernel memory. (CAN-2004-0685)\nThe ext3 and jfs code in kernels before 2.4.26 did not properly initialize\njournal descriptor blocks.  A privileged local user could read portions of\nkernel memory.  (CAN-2004-0177, CAN-2004-0181)\nThe following drivers have been updated:\n* fusion to 2.05.16.16.02\n* e1000 to 5.3.19-k2\n* e100 to 3.0.27-k2\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 users running Itanium are advised to\nupgrade their kernels to the packages listed in this erratum.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
