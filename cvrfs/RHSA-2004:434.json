This could cause an option such as \"all_squash\" to not be\napplied to all of the listed hosts.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0750 to\nthis issue.\nAdditionally, a bug was found that prevented redhat-config-nfs from being\nrun if hosts didn't have options set in /etc/exports.\nAll users of redhat-config-nfs are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages as well as checking their NFS shares directly or via the\n/etc/exports file for any incorrectly set options.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
