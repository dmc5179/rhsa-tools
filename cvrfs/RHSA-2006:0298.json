This\npackage includes the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and\nserver.\nAn arbitrary command execution flaw was discovered in the way scp copies\nfiles locally. It is possible for a local attacker to create a file with a\ncarefully crafted name that could execute arbitrary commands as the user\nrunning scp to copy files locally. (CVE-2006-0225)\nThe SSH daemon, when restricting host access by numeric IP addresses and\nwith VerifyReverseMapping disabled, allows remote attackers to bypass\n\"from=\" and \"user@host\" address restrictions by connecting to a host from a\nsystem whose reverse DNS hostname contains the numeric IP address.\n(CVE-2003-0386)\nThe following issues have also been fixed in this update:\n* If the sshd service was stopped using the sshd init script while the\nmain sshd daemon was not running, the init script would kill other sshd\nprocesses, such as the running sessions.  For example, this could happen\nwhen the 'service sshd stop' command was issued twice.\n* When privilege separation was enabled, the last login message was printed\nonly for the root user.\n* The sshd daemon was sending messages to the system log from a signal\nhandler when debug logging was enabled. This could cause a deadlock of\nthe user's connection.\nAll users of openssh should upgrade to these updated packages, which\nresolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
