A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.","Red Hat Ceph Storage is a scalable, open, software-defined storage platform\nthat combines the most stable version of the Ceph storage system with a\nCeph management platform, deployment utilities, and support services.\nSecurity Fix(es):\n* ceph: radosgw: HTTP header injection via CORS ExposeHeader tag (CVE-2020-10753)\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\nBug Fix(es):\n* Previously, BlueFS failed to replay log which was corrupted due to a previous written replay log. The BlueFS log corruption was caused by the BlueFS log growing exponentially because of OSD functioning in a way where sync_metadata was not invoked in some situations and if sync_metadata was invoked the BlueFS log was not getting compacted even though there is no new log data to flush. This log corruption caused Bluestore not to be mounted and data loss in multiple OSDs. With this update, sync_metadata is now invoked, BlueFS log is getting compacted even though  there is no new log data to flush in sync_metadata, and avoid log corruption if log is expanded. This prevents OSDs getting full due to BlueFS log growing exponentially and also BlueFS getting corrupted. As a result, logs replay and there is no data loss.
