The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0073 to this issue.\nMySQL 3.23.55 and earlier creates world-writable files and allows mysql\nusers to gain root privileges by using the \"SELECT * INFO OUTFILE\" operator\nto overwrite a configuration file and cause mysql to run as root upon\nrestart. (CAN-2003-0150)\nA signed integer vulnerability in the COM_TABLE_DUMP package for MySQL\n3.x to 3.23.53a allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n(crash or hang) in mysqld by causing large negative integers to be provided\nto a memcpy call. (CAN-2002-1373)\nThe COM_CHANGE_USER command in MySQL 3.x to 3.23.53a and 4.x to\n4.0.5a allows a remote attacker to gain privileges via a brute force\nattack using a one-character password. This causes MySQL to only compare\nthe provided password against the first character of the real\npassword. (CAN-2002-1374)\nThe COM_CHANGE_USER command in MySQL 3.x to 3.23.53a and 4.x to\n4.0.5a allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long\nresponse. (CAN-2002-1375)\nThe MySQL client library (libmysqlclient) in MySQL 3.x to 3.23.53a and 4.x\nto 4.0.5a does not properly verify length fields for certain responses\nin the read_rows or read_one_row routines, which allows a malicious server\nto cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CAN-2002-1376)\nAll users of MySQL are advised to upgrade to MySQL 3.23.56 contained within\nthis errata, which is not vulnerable to these issues.\nIn addition to the security fixes, these erratum packages contain a\nthread safe client library (libmysqlclient_r).","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
