An untrusted applet or application could use this flaw to elevate its\nprivileges and potentially execute arbitrary code as the user running the\njava virtual machine. (CVE-2007-3004)\nAn unspecified vulnerability was discovered in the Java Runtime\nEnvironment. An untrusted applet or application could cause the java\nvirtual machine to become unresponsive. (CVE-2007-3005)\nA flaw was found in the applet class loader. An untrusted applet could use\nthis flaw to circumvent network access restrictions, possibly connecting to\nservices hosted on the machine that executed the applet. (CVE-2007-3922)\nThese updated packages also add the following enhancements:\n* Time zone information has been updated to the latest available\ninformation, 2007h.\n* Accessibility support in AWT can now be disabled through a system\nproperty, java.assistive.  To support this change,  permission to read this\nproperty must be added to /opt/IBMJava2-131/jre/lib/security/java.policy.\nUsers of IBMJava2 who have modified this file should add this following\nline to the grant section:\npermission java.util.PropertyPermission \"java.assistive\", \"read\";\nAll users of IBMJava2 should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain IBM's 1.3.1 SR11 Java release, which resolves these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
