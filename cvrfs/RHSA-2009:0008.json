It is used for\nthe system-wide message bus service and as a per-user-login-session\nmessaging facility.\nA denial-of-service flaw was discovered in the system for sending messages\nbetween applications. A local user could send a message with a malformed\nsignature to the bus causing the bus (and, consequently, any process using\nlibdbus to receive messages) to abort. (CVE-2008-3834)\nAll users are advised to upgrade to these updated dbus packages, which\ncontain backported patch which resolve this issue. For the update to take\neffect, all running instances of dbus-daemon and all running applications\nusing libdbus library must be restarted, or the system rebooted.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
