This package\nprovides a set of core providers and development tools for systems\nmanagement applications.\nIt was discovered that certain sblim libraries had an RPATH (runtime\nlibrary search path) set in the ELF (Executable and Linking Format) header.\nThis RPATH pointed to a sub-directory of a world-writable, temporary\ndirectory. A local user could create a file with the same name as a library\nrequired by sblim (such as libc.so) and place it in the directory defined\nin the RPATH. This file could then execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user running an application that used sblim (eg\ntog-pegasus). (CVE-2008-1951)\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these updated sblim packages, which resolve\nthis issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
