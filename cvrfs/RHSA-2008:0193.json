Authorized local\nusers who have limited privileges could then exploit this to gain\nadditional access, or to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2008-0884)\nThis issue only affects users who have installed either of these packages\nfrom the Red Hat FTP site as their base system configuration kickstart\nscript.\nNew deployments using the lspp-eal4-config-ibm or capp-lspp-eal4-config-hp\npackages are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve\nthis issue.\nFor systems already deployed, the following command can be run as root to\nrestore the permissions to a secure setting:\nchmod 0644 /etc/pam.d/system-auth","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
