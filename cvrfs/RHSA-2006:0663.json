An attacker could create a carefully crafted file\nthat could execute arbitrary code if uncompressed by a victim. (CVE-2006-1168)\nIn addition, two bugs that affected Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 ncompress\npackages were fixed:\n* The display statistics and compression results in verbose mode were not\nshown when operating on zero length files.\n* An attempt to compress zero length files resulted in an unexpected return\ncode.\nUsers of ncompress are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
