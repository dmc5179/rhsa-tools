A remote attacker using packets larger\nthan the MTU could bypass the existing fragment check, resulting in\npartial, invalid frames being passed to the network stack. These flaws\ncould also possibly be used to trigger a remote denial of service.\n(CVE-2009-4536, CVE-2009-4538, Important)\n* a flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux\nkernel. Receiving overly-long frames with network cards supported by this\ndriver could possibly result in a remote denial of service. (CVE-2009-4537,\nImportant)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
