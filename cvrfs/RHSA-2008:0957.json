We have updated the\npackages to correct this bug.","The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n* the Xen implementation did not prevent applications running in a\npara-virtualized guest from modifying CR4 TSC. This could cause a local\ndenial of service. (CVE-2007-5907, Important)\n* Tavis Ormandy reported missing boundary checks in the Virtual Dynamic\nShared Objects (vDSO) implementation. This could allow a local unprivileged\nuser to cause a denial of service or escalate privileges. (CVE-2008-3527,\nImportant)\n* the do_truncate() and generic_file_splice_write() functions did not clear\nthe setuid and setgid bits. This could allow a local unprivileged user to\nobtain access to privileged information. (CVE-2008-4210, CVE-2008-3833,\nImportant)\n* a flaw was found in the Linux kernel splice implementation. This could\ncause a local denial of service when there is a certain failure in the\nadd_to_page_cache_lru() function. (CVE-2008-4302, Important)\n* a flaw was found in the Linux kernel when running on AMD64 systems.\nDuring a context switch, EFLAGS were being neither saved nor restored. This\ncould allow a local unprivileged user to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2006-5755, Low)\n* a flaw was found in the Linux kernel virtual memory implementation. This\ncould allow a local unprivileged user to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2008-2372, Low)\n* an integer overflow was discovered in the Linux kernel Datagram\nCongestion Control Protocol (DCCP) implementation. This could allow a\nremote attacker to cause a denial of service. By default, remote DCCP is\nblocked by SELinux. (CVE-2008-3276, Low)\nIn addition, these updated packages fix the following bugs:\n* random32() seeding has been improved. \n* in a multi-core environment, a race between the QP async event-handler\nand the destro_qp() function could occur. This led to unpredictable results\nduring invalid memory access, which could lead to a kernel crash.\n* a format string was omitted in the call to the request_module() function.\n* a stack overflow caused by an infinite recursion bug in the binfmt_misc\nkernel module was corrected.\n* the ata_scsi_rbuf_get() and ata_scsi_rbuf_put() functions now check for\nscatterlist usage before calling kmap_atomic().\n* a sentinel NUL byte was added to the device_write() function to ensure\nthat lspace.name is NUL-terminated.\n* in the character device driver, a range_is_allowed() check was added to\nthe read_mem() and write_mem() functions. It was possible for an\nillegitimate application to bypass these checks, and access /dev/mem beyond\nthe 1M limit by calling mmap_mem() instead. Also, the parameters of\nrange_is_allowed() were changed to cleanly handle greater than 32-bits of\nphysical address on 32-bit architectures.\n* some of the newer Nehalem-based systems declare their CPU DSDT entries as\ntype \"Alias\". During boot, this caused an \"Error attaching device data\"\nmessage to be logged.\n* the evtchn event channel device lacked locks and memory barriers. This\nhas led to xenstore becoming unresponsive on the ItaniumÂ® architecture.\n* sending of gratuitous ARP packets in the Xen frontend network driver is\nnow delayed until the backend signals that its carrier status has been\nprocessed by the stack.\n* on forcedeth devices, whenever setting ethtool parameters for link speed,\nthe device could stop receiving interrupts.\n* the CIFS 'forcedirectio' option did not allow text to be appended to files.\n* the gettimeofday() function returned a backwards time on IntelÂ® 64.\n* residual-count corrections during UNDERRUN handling were added to the\nqla2xxx driver.                                                   \n* the fix for a small quirk was removed for certain Adaptec controllers for\nwhich it caused problems.\n* the \"xm trigger init\" command caused a domain panic if a userland\napplication was running on a guest on the IntelÂ® 64 architecture.\nUsers of kernel should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
