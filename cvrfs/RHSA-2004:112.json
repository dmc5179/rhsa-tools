Network Security Services (NSS)\nis a set of libraries designed to support cross-platform development of\nsecurity-enabled server applications. \nNISCC testing of implementations of the S/MIME protocol uncovered a number\nof bugs in NSS versions prior to 3.9.   The parsing of unexpected ASN.1\nconstructs within S/MIME data could cause Mozilla to crash or consume large\namounts of memory.  A remote attacker could potentially trigger these bugs\nby sending a carefully-crafted S/MIME message to a victim.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0564 to this issue. \nAndreas Sandblad discovered a cross-site scripting issue that affects\nvarious versions of Mozilla.  When linking to a new page it is still\npossible to interact with the old page before the new page has been\nsuccessfully loaded. Any Javascript events will be invoked in the context\nof the new page, making cross-site scripting possible if the different\npages belong to different domains.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0191 to\nthis issue. \nFlaws have been found in the cookie path handling between a number of Web\nbrowsers and servers. The HTTP cookie standard allows a Web server\nsupplying a cookie to a client to specify a subset of URLs on the origin\nserver to which the cookie applies. Web servers such as Apache do not\nfilter returned cookies and assume that the client will only send back\ncookies for requests that fall within the server-supplied subset of URLs.\nHowever, by supplying URLs that use path traversal (/../) and character\nencoding, it is possible to fool many browsers into sending a cookie to a\npath outside of the originally-specified subset.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0594 to this issue. \nUsers of Mozilla are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain Mozilla version 1.4.2 and are not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
