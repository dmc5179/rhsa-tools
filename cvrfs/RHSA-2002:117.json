Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains\nthe desired RPMs.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2002:117"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Moderate","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["The Apache Web server contains a security vulnerability which can be used\nto launch a denial of service attack (DoS), or in some cases, allow remote\ncode execution.  Red Hat Secure Web server is based on the Apache Web\nserver and the secureweb package has been updated to fix this denial of service\nvulnerability.","Versions of the Apache Web server up to and including 1.3.24 contain a bug\nin the routines which deal with requests that are processed with \"chunked\"\nencoding. A carefully crafted invalid request can cause an Apache child\nprocess to call the memcpy() function in a way that will write past the end\nof its buffer, corrupting the stack.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0392 to this issue.\nOur investigations show that this bug cannot be used to gain remote access\nto a server running Red Hat Secure Web Server, but it does cause the child\nprocess to die. The Apache parent process will notice this and start a new\nchild process when necessary -- using slightly more resources than normal.  \nAll users of Secure Web Server should update to these errata packages to\ncorrect this security issue.  \nNOTE: Pay special attention to the installation instructions in the\n\"Solution\" section below as they differ from standard upgrade instructions.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
