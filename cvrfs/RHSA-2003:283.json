The sucessful exploitation of this bug can lead\nto heap and stack structure overflows.  Although no exploit currently\nexists, this issue is locally exploitable and may also be remotely\nexploitable. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0694 to this issue.\nAdditionally, for Red Hat Linux 8.0 and 9 we have included a fix for a\npotential buffer overflow in ruleset parsing.  This problem is not\nexploitable in the default sendmail configuration; it is exploitable only\nif non-standard rulesets recipient (2), final (4), or mailer-specific\nenvelope recipients rulesets are used.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0681 to\nthis issue.\nAll users are advised to update to these erratum packages containing a\nbackported patch which corrects these vulnerabilities.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
