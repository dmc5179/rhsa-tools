In these\nversions, Pine does not allocate enough memory for the parsing and escaping\nof the \"From\" header, allowing a carefully crafted email to cause a\nbuffer overflow on the heap. This will result in Pine crashing.\nAll users of Pine on Red Hat Linux are advised to update to these errata\npackages containing a patch to version 4.44 of Pine that fixes this\nvulnerability.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
