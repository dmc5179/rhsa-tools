The problem only occurred when running the 32-bit x86\nkernel on 64-bit dual-core x86_64 hardware.\nNote: The kernel-unsupported package contains various drivers and modules\nthat are unsupported and therefore might contain security problems that\nhave not been addressed. \nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 users are advised to upgrade their kernels\nto the packages associated with their machine architecture and\nconfigurations as listed in this erratum.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
