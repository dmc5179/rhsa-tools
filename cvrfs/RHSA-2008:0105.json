No changes have been made to the packages.","Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Thunderbird\nprocessed messages with external-body Multipurpose Internet Message\nExtensions (MIME) types. A HTML mail message containing malicious content\ncould cause Thunderbird to execute arbitrary code as the user running\nThunderbird. (CVE-2008-0304)\nSeveral flaws were found in the way Thunderbird processed certain malformed\nHTML mail content. A HTML mail message containing malicious content could\ncause Thunderbird to crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code as the\nuser running Thunderbird. (CVE-2008-0412, CVE-2008-0413, CVE-2008-0415,\nCVE-2008-0419)\nSeveral flaws were found in the way Thunderbird displayed malformed HTML\nmail content. A HTML mail message containing specially-crafted content\ncould trick a user into surrendering sensitive information. (CVE-2008-0420,\nCVE-2008-0591, CVE-2008-0593)\nA flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handles certain chrome URLs. If a\nuser has certain extensions installed, it could allow a malicious HTML mail\nmessage to steal sensitive session data. Note: this flaw does not affect a\ndefault installation of Thunderbird. (CVE-2008-0418)\nNote: JavaScript support is disabled by default in Thunderbird; the above\nissues are not exploitable unless JavaScript is enabled.\nA flaw was found in the way Thunderbird saves certain text files. If a\nremote site offers a file of type \"plain/text\", rather than \"text/plain\",\nThunderbird will not show future \"text/plain\" content to the user, forcing\nthem to save those files locally to view the content. (CVE-2008-0592)\nUsers of thunderbird are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain backported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
