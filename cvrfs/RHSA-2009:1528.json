An\nauthenticated, remote user could send a specially-crafted response that\nwould cause an smbd child process to enter an infinite loop. An\nauthenticated, remote user could use this flaw to exhaust system resources\nby opening multiple CIFS sessions. (CVE-2009-2906)\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n* the RHSA-2007:0354 update added code to escape input passed to scripts\nthat are run by Samba. This code was missing \"c\" from the list of valid\ncharacters, causing it to be escaped. With this update, the previous patch\nhas been updated to include \"c\" in the list of valid characters.\n(BZ#242754)\nUsers of Samba should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a\nbackported patch to correct this issue. After installing this update,\nthe smb service will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
