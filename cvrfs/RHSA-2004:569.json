These include CAN-2004-0835,\nCAN-2004-0836, CAN-2004-0837, and CAN-2004-0957.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n3 does not ship with the mysql-server package and is therefore not affected\nby these issues.\nThis update also allows 32-bit and 64-bit libraries to be installed\nconcurrently on the same system.\nAll users of mysql should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve\nthese issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
