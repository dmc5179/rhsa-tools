A webpage containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey\nto crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code as the user running\nSeaMonkey. (CVE-2008-0412, CVE-2008-0413, CVE-2008-0415, CVE-2008-0419)\nSeveral flaws were found in the way SeaMonkey displayed malformed web\ncontent. A webpage containing specially-crafted content could trick a user\ninto surrendering sensitive information. (CVE-2008-0591, CVE-2008-0593)\nA flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey stored password data. If a user\nsaves login information for a malicious website, it could be possible\nto corrupt the password database, preventing the user from properly\naccessing saved password data. (CVE-2008-0417)\nA flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handles certain chrome URLs. If a\nuser has certain extensions installed, it could allow a malicious website\nto steal sensitive session data. Note: this flaw does not affect a default\ninstallation of SeaMonkey. (CVE-2008-0418)\nA flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey saves certain text files. If a\nwebsite offers a file of type \"plain/text\", rather than \"text/plain\",\nSeaMonkey will not show future \"text/plain\" content to the user in the\nbrowser, forcing them to save those files locally to view the content.\n(CVE-2008-0592)\nUsers of SeaMonkey are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
