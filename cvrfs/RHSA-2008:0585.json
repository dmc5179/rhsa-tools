This could allow a local\nunprivileged user to execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service\n(kernel panic). (CVE-2007-5966, Important)\n* the possibility of a kernel crash was found in the Linux kernel IPsec\nprotocol implementation, due to improper handling of fragmented ESP\npackets. When an attacker controlling an intermediate router fragmented\nthese packets into very small pieces, it would cause a kernel crash on the\nreceiving node during packet reassembly. (CVE-2007-6282, Important)\n* on 64-bit architectures, the possibility of a timer-expiration value\noverflow was found in the Linux kernel high-resolution timers\nfunctionality, hrtimer. This could allow a local unprivileged user to set\nup a large interval value, forcing the timer expiry value to become\nnegative, causing a denial of service (kernel hang). \n(CVE-2007-6712, Important)\n* on AMD64 architectures, the possibility of a kernel crash was discovered\nby testing the Linux kernel process-trace ability. This could allow a local\nunprivileged user to cause a denial of service (kernel crash).\n(CVE-2008-1615, Important)\n* a possible kernel memory leak was found in the Linux kernel Simple\nInternet Transition (SIT) INET6 implementation. This could allow a local\nunprivileged user to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2008-2136, Important)\n* a flaw was found in the Linux kernel utimensat system call. File\npermissions were not checked when UTIME_NOW and UTIME_OMIT combinations\nwere used. This could allow a local unprivileged user to modify file times\nof arbitrary files, possibly leading to a denial of service.\n(CVE-2008-2148, Important)\n* a security flaw was found in the Linux kernel memory copy routines, when\nrunning on certain AMD64 architectures. If an unsuccessful attempt to copy\nkernel memory from source to destination memory locations occurred, the\ncopy routines did not zero the content at the destination memory location.\nThis could allow a local unprivileged user to view potentially sensitive\ndata. (CVE-2008-2729, Important)\n* Gabriel Campana discovered a possible integer overflow flaw in the Linux \nkernel Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation. This\ndeficiency could lead to privilege escalation. (CVE-2008-2826, Important)\n* a deficiency was found in the Linux kernel virtual memory implementation.\nThis could allow a local unprivileged user to make a large number of calls\nto the get_user_pages function, possibly causing a denial of service.\n(CVE-2008-2372, Low)\nAlso, these updated packages fix the following bugs:\n* gdb set orig_rax to 0x00000000ffffffff, which is recognized by the\nupstream kernel as \"-1\", but not by the Red Hat Enterprise MRG kernel.\n* if the POSIX timer was programmed to fire immediately, the timer's\nsignal was sometimes not delivered (timer does not fire).\n* rwlock caused crashes and application hangs.\n* running oprofile caused system panics.\n* threads releasing a mutex may have received an EPERM error.\n* booting the RT kernel with the \"nmi_watchdog=2\" kernel option caused a\nkernel panic, and an \"Unable to handle kernel paging request\" error.\n* \"echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online\" caused crashes.\n* a crash on a JTC machine.\n* added a new \"FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET\" system call, identical to FUTEX_WAIT,\nthat accepts absolute time as a timeout.\nRed Hat Enterprise MRG 1.0 users are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain backported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
