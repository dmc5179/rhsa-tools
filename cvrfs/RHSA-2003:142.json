LPRng includes a program, psbanner, that can be\nused to produce Postscript banner pages to separate print jobs.  \nA vulnerability has been found in psbanner, which creates a temporary file\nwith a known filename in an insecure manner.  An attacker could create a\nsymbolic link and cause arbitrary files to be written as the 'lp' user.\nNote: psbanner is not used by the default Red Hat Linux LPRng configuration.\nUsers that have configured LPRng to use psbanner should install these\nupdated packages, which contain a patch so that psbanner does not create\nthe temporary file.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
