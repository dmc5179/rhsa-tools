Buffer overflows in Icecast\n1.3.11 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a\nlong HTTP GET request. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-0177 to this issue.\nAdditional buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in previous versions of\nIcecast that are also fixed by this update.  These vulnerabilities can\ncause denial of service attacks as well as arbitrary code execution. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe names CAN-2001-0784, CAN-2001-1083, CAN-2001-1229, and CAN-2001-1230 to\nthese issues.\nUsers of Icecast are advised to update to the errata packages containing\nIcecast 1.3.12 which is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
