This could aid in the local\nexploitation of NULL pointer dereference bugs. (CVE-2009-2695, Important)\n* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in each of the following\nfunctions in the Linux kernel: pipe_read_open(), pipe_write_open(), and\npipe_rdwr_open(). When the mutex lock is not held, the i_pipe pointer could\nbe released by other processes before it is used to update the pipe's\nreader and writer counters. This could lead to a local denial of service or\nprivilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3547, Important)\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n* a bug in the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel could have caused an\nunbalanced reference count. When using network bonding, this bug may have\ncaused a hang when shutting the system down via \"shutdown -h\", or prevented\nthe network service from being stopped via \"service network stop\".\n(BZ#538409)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
