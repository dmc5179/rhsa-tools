An attacker was able to perform cross-site scripting (XSS)\nattacks in certain applications (CVE-2007-1358).\nSome JSPs within the 'examples' web application did not escape user\nprovided data. If the JSP examples were accessible, this flaw could allow a\nremote attacker to perform cross-site scripting attacks (CVE-2007-2449).\nNote: it is recommended the 'examples' web application not be installed on\na production system.\nThe Manager and Host Manager web applications did not escape user provided\ndata. If a user is logged in to the Manager or Host Manager web\napplication, an attacker could perform a cross-site scripting attack\n(CVE-2007-2450). \nTomcat was found treating single quote characters -- ' -- as delimiters in\ncookies. This could allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information,\nsuch as session IDs, for session hijacking attacks (CVE-2007-3382).\nIt was reported Tomcat did not properly handle the following character\nsequence in a cookie: \\\" (a backslash followed by a double-quote). It was\npossible remote attackers could use this failure to obtain sensitive\ninformation, such as session IDs, for session hijacking attacks\n(CVE-2007-3385).\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability existed in the Host Manager\nServlet. This allowed remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTML and web\nscript via crafted requests (CVE-2007-3386).\nUsers of Tomcat should update to these erratum packages, which contain\nbackported patches and are not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
