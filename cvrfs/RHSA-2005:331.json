It\nprovides the basic low-level functionality that full-fledged graphical\nuser interfaces (GUIs) such as GNOME and KDE are designed upon.\nAn integer overflow flaw was found in libXpm, which is used by some\napplications for loading of XPM images. An attacker could create a\nmalicious XPM file that would execute arbitrary code if opened by a victim\nusing an application linked to the vulnerable library. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2005-0605 to this issue.\nThe updated XFree86 packages also address the following minor issues:\n- Updated XFree86-4.3.0-keyboard-disable-ioport-access-v3.patch to make\nwarning messages less alarmist.\n- Backported XFree86-4.3.0-libX11-stack-overflow.patch from xorg-x11-6.8.1\npackaging to fix stack overflow in libX11, which was discovered by new\nsecurity features of gcc4.\nUsers of XFree86 should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a\nbackported patch and are not vulnerable to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
