Gdm allows you to log into your system with\nthe X Window System running and supports running several different X\nsessions on your local machine at the same time.\nA flaw was found in the way Gdm listens on its unix domain socket.  A local\nuser could crash a running X session by writing malicious data to Gdm's\nunix domain socket.
