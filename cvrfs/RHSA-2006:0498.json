XScreenSaver did not properly\nensure it had proper keyboard focus, which could leak a users password to\nthe program with keyboard focus. This behavior is not common, as only certain\napplications exhibit this focus error. (CVE-2004-2655)\nSeveral flaws were found in the way various XScreenSaver screensavers\ncreate temporary files. It may be possible for a local attacker to create a\ntemporary file in way that could overwrite a different file to which the user\nrunning XScreenSaver has write permissions. (CVE-2003-1294)\nUsers of XScreenSaver should upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
