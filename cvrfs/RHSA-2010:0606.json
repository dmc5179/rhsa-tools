Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.","The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n* a flaw was found in the CIFSSMBWrite() function in the Linux kernel\nCommon Internet File System (CIFS) implementation. A remote attacker could\nsend a specially-crafted SMB response packet to a target CIFS client,\nresulting in a kernel panic (denial of service). (CVE-2010-2248, Important)\n* buffer overflow flaws were found in the Linux kernel's implementation of\nthe server-side External Data Representation (XDR) for the Network File\nSystem (NFS) version 4. An attacker on the local network could send a\nspecially-crafted large compound request to the NFSv4 server, which could\npossibly result in a kernel panic (denial of service) or, potentially, code\nexecution. (CVE-2010-2521, Important)\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n* the rpc_call_async() function in the SUN Remote Procedure Call (RPC)\nsubsystem in the Linux kernel had a reference counting bug. In certain\nsituations, some Network Lock Manager (NLM) messages may have triggered\nthis bug on NFSv2 and NFSv3 servers, leading to a kernel panic (with\n\"kernel BUG at fs/lockd/host.c:[xxx]!\" logged to \"/var/log/messages\").\n(BZ#612962)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
