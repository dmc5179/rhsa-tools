These updated errata packages contain a patch to correct this bug.","The glibc package contains standard libraries which are used by\nmultiple programs on the system.  Sun RPC is a remote procedure call\nframework which allows clients to invoke procedures in a server process\nover a network.  XDR is a mechanism for encoding data structures for use\nwith RPC.  NFS, NIS, and other network services that are built upon Sun\nRPC.  The glibc package contains an XDR encoder/decoder derived from Sun's\nRPC implementation which was recently demonstrated to be vulnerable to a\nheap overflow.\nAn error in the calculation of memory needed for unpacking arrays in the\nXDR decoder can result in a heap buffer overflow in glibc 2.2.5 and\nearlier.  Depending upon the application, this vulnerability may be\nexploitable and could lead to arbitrary code execution.  (CAN-2002-0391)\nA buffer overflow vulnerability has been found in the way the glibc\nresolver handles the resolution of network names and addresses via DNS (as\nper Internet RFC 1011). Version 2.2.5 of glibc and earlier versions are\naffected. A system would be vulnerable to this issue if the\n\"networks\" database in the /etc/nsswitch.conf file includes the \"dns\"\nentry. By default, Red Hat Linux Advanced Server ships with \"networks\"\nset to \"files\" and is therefore not vulnerable to this issue.\n(CAN-2002-0684)\nA related issue is a bug in the glibc-compat packages, which\nprovide compatibility for applications compiled against glibc version\n2.0.x. Applications compiled against this version (such as those\ndistributed with early Red Hat Linux releases 5.0, 5.1, and 5.2) could also\nbe vulnerable to this issue. (CAN-2002-0651)\nAll users should upgrade to these errata packages which contain patches to\nthe glibc libraries and therefore are not vulnerable to these issues.\nThanks to Solar Designer for providing patches for this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
