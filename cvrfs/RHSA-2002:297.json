Many \npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network, \nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command: \nup2date \nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the \nappropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2002:297"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Important","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated vim packages are now available for Red Hat Linux.  These \nupdates resolve a security issue when opening a specially crafted text \nfile.\n[Updated 16 April 2003]\nAdded packages for Red Hat Linux on IBM iSeries and pSeries systems.","VIM (Vi IMproved) is a version of the vi editor.  \nVIM allows a user to set the modeline differently for each edited text \nfile by placing special comments in the files.  Georgi Guninski found that\nthese comments can be carefully crafted in order to call external programs.\nThis could allow an attacker to create a text file such that when it is\nopened arbitrary commands are executed.   \nUsers of VIM are advised to upgrade to these errata packages which have \nbeen patched to disable the usage of dangerous functions in modelines.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
