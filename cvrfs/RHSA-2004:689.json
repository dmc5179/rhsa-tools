A local attacker could use\nthis flaw to gain privileges. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1144 to this issue.\nISEC security research discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the IGMP\nfunctionality which was backported in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3\nkernels.  These flaws could allow a local user to cause a denial of\nservice (crash) or potentially gain privileges.  Where multicast\napplications are being used on a system, these flaws may also allow remote\nusers to cause a denial of service.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1137 to\nthis issue.\nISEC security research and Georgi Guninski independantly discovered a flaw\nin the scm_send function in the auxiliary message layer.  A local user\ncould create a carefully crafted auxiliary message which could cause a\ndenial of service (system hang).  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1016 to this issue.\nA floating point information leak was discovered in the ia64 architecture\ncontext switch code.  A local user could use this flaw to read register\nvalues of other processes by setting the MFH bit. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the\nname CAN-2004-0565 to this issue.\nKirill Korotaev found a flaw in load_elf_binary affecting kernels prior to\n2.4.26.  A local user could create a carefully crafted binary in such a\nway that it would cause a denial of service (system crash).  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the\nname CAN-2004-1234 to this issue.\nThese packages also fix issues in the io_edgeport driver, and a memory leak\nin ip_options_get.\nNote: The kernel-unsupported package contains various drivers and modules\nthat are unsupported and therefore might contain security problems that\nhave not been addressed.\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 users are advised to upgrade their\nkernels to the packages associated with their machine architectures\nand configurations as listed in this erratum.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
