This update deprecates the Mozilla Firefox 1.0 branch in\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 4 in favor of the supported Mozilla Firefox\n1.5 branch.\nThis update also resolves a number of outstanding Firefox security issues:\nSeveral flaws were found in the way Firefox processed certain javascript\nactions. A malicious web page could execute arbitrary javascript\ninstructions with the permissions of \"chrome\", allowing the page to steal\nsensitive information or install browser malware. (CVE-2006-2776,\nCVE-2006-2784, CVE-2006-2785, CVE-2006-2787, CVE-2006-3807, CVE-2006-3809,\nCVE-2006-3812)\nSeveral denial of service flaws were found in the way Firefox processed\ncertain web content. A malicious web page could crash the browser or\npossibly execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.\n(CVE-2006-2779, CVE-2006-2780, CVE-2006-3801, CVE-2006-3677, CVE-2006-3113,\nCVE-2006-3803, CVE-2006-3805, CVE-2006-3806, CVE-2006-3811)\nA cross-site scripting flaw was found in the way Firefox processed\nUnicode Byte-Order-Mark (BOM) markers in UTF-8 web pages. A malicious web\npage could execute a script within the browser that a web input sanitizer\ncould miss due to a malformed \"script\" tag. (CVE-2006-2783)\nSeveral flaws were found in the way Firefox processed certain javascript\nactions. A malicious web page could conduct a cross-site scripting attack\nor steal sensitive information (such as cookies owned by other domains).\n(CVE-2006-3802, CVE-2006-3810)\nA form file upload flaw was found in the way Firefox handled javascript\ninput object mutation. A malicious web page could upload an arbitrary local\nfile at form submission time without user interaction. (CVE-2006-2782)\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way Firefox called the\ncrypto.signText() javascript function. A malicious web page could crash the\nbrowser if the victim had a client certificate loaded. (CVE-2006-2778)\nTwo HTTP response smuggling flaws were found in the way Firefox processed\ncertain invalid HTTP response headers. A malicious web site could return\nspecially crafted HTTP response headers which may bypass HTTP proxy\nrestrictions. (CVE-2006-2786)\nA flaw was found in the way Firefox processed Proxy AutoConfig scripts. A\nmalicious Proxy AutoConfig server could execute arbitrary javascript\ninstructions with the permissions of \"chrome\", allowing the page to steal\nsensitive information or install browser malware. (CVE-2006-3808)\nA double free flaw was found in the way the nsIX509::getRawDER method was\ncalled. If a victim visited a carefully crafted web page, it was possible\nto execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox. (CVE-2006-2788)\nUsers of Firefox are advised to upgrade to this update, which contains\nFirefox version 1.5.0.5 that corrects these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
