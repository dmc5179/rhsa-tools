(CVE-2006-4226)\nMySQL evaluated arguments in the wrong security context which allowed\nremote authenticated users to gain privileges through a routine that had\nbeen made available using GRANT EXECUTE.  (CVE-2006-4227)\nMySQL allowed a local user to access a table through a previously created\nMERGE table, even after the user's privileges were revoked for the original\ntable, which might violate intended security policy.  (CVE-2006-4031)\nMySQL allowed authenticated users to cause a denial of service (crash) via\na NULL second argument to the str_to_date function.  (CVE-2006-3081)\nMySQL allowed local authenticated users to bypass logging mechanisms via\nSQL queries that contain the NULL character, which were not properly\nhandled by the mysql_real_query function.  (CVE-2006-0903)\nUsers of MySQL should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve\nthese issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
