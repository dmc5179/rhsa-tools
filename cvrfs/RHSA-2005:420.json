This is the\nfirst regular update.\n[Updated 9 August 2005]\nThe advisory text has been updated to show that this update also contained\nfixes for the security issues named CAN-2005-0209 and CAN-2005-0937.  No\nchanges have been made to the packages associated with this advisory.","The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.\nThis is the first regular kernel update to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.\nA flaw affecting the auditing code was discovered.  On Itanium\narchitectures a local user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service\n(crash).  This issue is rated as having important security impact\n(CAN-2005-0136). \nA flaw was discovered in the servicing of a raw device ioctl.  A local user\nwho has access to raw devices could use this flaw to write to kernel memory\nand cause a denial of service or potentially gain privileges.  This issue\nis rated as having moderate security impact (CAN-2005-1264). \nA flaw in fragment forwarding was discovered that affected the netfilter\nsubsystem for certain network interface cards. A remote attacker could send\na set of bad fragments and cause a denial of service (system crash). Acenic\nand SunGEM network interfaces were the only adapters affected, which are in\nwidespread use. (CAN-2005-0209)\nA flaw in the futex functions was discovered affecting the Linux 2.6\nkernel.  A local user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CAN-2005-0937)\nNew features introduced by this update include:\n- Fixed TCP BIC congestion handling.\n- Diskdump support for more controllers (megaraid, SATA)\n- Device mapper multipath support\n- AMD64 dual core support.\n- Intel ICH7 hardware support.\nThere were many bug fixes in various parts of the kernel.  The ongoing\neffort to resolve these problems has resulted in a marked improvement\nin the reliability and scalability of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.\nThe following device drivers have been upgraded to new versions:\nata_piix -------- 1.03\nbonding --------- 2.6.1\ne1000 ----------- 5.6.10.1-k2-NAPI\ne100 ------------ 3.3.6-k2-NAPI\nibmveth --------- 1.03\nlibata ---------- 1.02 to 1.10\nlpfc ------------ 0:8.0.16 to 0:8.0.16.6_x2\nmegaraid_mbox --- 2.20.4.0 to 2.20.4.5\nmegaraid_mm ----- 2.20.2.0-rh1 to 2.20.2.5\nsata_nv --------- 0.03 to 0.6\nsata_promise ---- 1.00 to 1.01\nsata_sil -------- 0.8\nsata_sis -------- 0.5\nsata_svw -------- 1.05\nsata_sx4 -------- 0.7\nsata_via -------- 1.0\nsata_vsc -------- 1.0\ntg3 ------------- 3.22-rh\nipw2100 --------- 1.0.3\nipw2200 --------- 1.0.0\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users are advised to upgrade their\nkernels to the packages associated with their machine architectures\nand configurations as listed in this erratum.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
