(CAN-2004-0075)\nThe ext3 and jfs code did not properly initialize journal descriptor\nblocks.  A privileged local user could read portions of kernel memory.\n(CAN-2004-0177)\nThe terminal layer did not properly lock line discipline changes or pending\nIO.  An unprivileged local user could read portions of kernel memory, or\ncause a denial of service (system crash). (CAN-2004-0814)\nA race condition was discovered.  Local users could use this flaw to read\nthe environment variables of another process that is still spawning via\n/proc/.../cmdline. (CAN-2004-1058)\nA flaw in the execve() syscall handling was discovered, allowing a local\nuser to read setuid ELF binaries that should otherwise be protected by\nstandard permissions. (CAN-2004-1073).  Red Hat originally reported this\nas being fixed by RHSA-2004:549, but the associated fix was missing from\nthat update.\nKeith Owens reported a flaw in the Itanium unw_unwind_to_user() function.\nA local user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash) on the Itanium architecture. (CAN-2005-0135)\nA missing Itanium syscall table entry could allow an unprivileged\nlocal user to cause a denial of service (system crash) on the Itanium\narchitecture. (CAN-2005-0137)\nA flaw affecting the OUTS instruction on the AMD64 and Intel EM64T\narchitectures was discovered.  A local user could use this flaw to\naccess privileged IO ports. (CAN-2005-0204)\nA flaw was discovered in the Linux PPP driver.  On systems allowing remote\nusers to connect to a server using ppp, a remote client could cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CAN-2005-0384)\nA flaw in the Red Hat backport of NPTL to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 was\ndiscovered that left a pointer to a freed tty structure.  A local user\ncould potentially use this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash)\nor possibly gain read or write access to ttys that should normally be\nprevented. (CAN-2005-0403)\nA flaw in fragment queuing was discovered affecting the netfilter\nsubsystem.  On systems configured to filter or process network packets (for\nexample those configured to do firewalling), a remote attacker could send a\ncarefully crafted set of fragmented packets to a machine and cause a denial\nof service (system crash).  In order to sucessfully exploit this flaw, the\nattacker would need to know (or guess) some aspects of the firewall ruleset\nin place on the target system to be able to craft the right fragmented\npackets. (CAN-2005-0449)\nMissing validation of an epoll_wait() system call parameter could allow\na local user to cause a denial of service (system crash) on the IBM S/390\nand zSeries architectures. (CAN-2005-0736)\nA flaw when freeing a pointer in load_elf_library was discovered.  A local\nuser could potentially use this flaw to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CAN-2005-0749)\nA flaw was discovered in the bluetooth driver system.  On system where the\nbluetooth modules are loaded, a local user could use this flaw to gain\nelevated (root) privileges. (CAN-2005-0750)\nIn addition to the security issues listed above, there was an important\nfix made to the handling of the msync() system call for a particular case\nin which the call could return without queuing modified mmap()'ed data for\nfile system update. (BZ 147969)\nNote: The kernel-unsupported package contains various drivers and modules\nthat are unsupported and therefore might contain security problems that\nhave not been addressed.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 3 users are advised to upgrade their kernels to\nthe packages associated with their machine architectures/configurations\nPlease note that the fix for CAN-2005-0449 required changing the\nexternal symbol linkages (kernel module ABI) for the ip_defrag()\nand ip_ct_gather_frags() functions.  Any third-party module using either\nof these would also need to be fixed.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
