A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,\nwhich gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in\nthe References section.","The GFS-kernel packages contain modules that provide the ability to mount\nand use GFS file systems.\nA flaw was found in the gfs_lock() implementation. The GFS locking code\ncould skip the lock operation for files that have the S_ISGID bit\n(set-group-ID on execution) in their mode set. A local, unprivileged user\non a system that has a GFS file system mounted could use this flaw to cause\na kernel panic. (CVE-2010-0727)\nAs well, these updated GFS-kernel packages are in sync with the latest\nkernel (2.6.9-89.0.20.EL). The modules in earlier GFS-kernel packages fail\nto load because they do not match the running kernel. It is possible to\nforce-load the modules; however, with this update, force-loading the\nmodules is not required.\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these latest GFS-kernel packages, which\nresolve this issue and are updated for use with the 2.6.9-89.0.20.EL\nkernel.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
