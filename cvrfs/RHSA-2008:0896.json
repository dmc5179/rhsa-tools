A remote attacker could\nuse this flaw to spoof a malicious reply to a DNS query. (CVE-2008-3905)\nA number of flaws were found in the safe-level restrictions in Ruby. It\nwas possible for an attacker to create a carefully crafted malicious script\nthat can allow the bypass of certain safe-level restrictions. (CVE-2008-3655)\nA denial of service flaw was found in Ruby's regular expression engine. If\na Ruby script tried to process a large amount of data via a regular\nexpression, it could cause Ruby to enter an infinite-loop and crash.\n(CVE-2008-3443)\nUsers of ruby should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
