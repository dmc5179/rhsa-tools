If Tomcat was used behind mod_jk and configured to only\nproxy some contexts, an attacker could construct a carefully crafted HTTP\nrequest to work around the context restriction and potentially access\nnon-proxied content (CVE-2007-1860).\nUsers of mod_jk should upgrade to these updated packages, which address\nthis issue by changing the default so mod_jk forwards the original\nunchanged request URL to Tomcat.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
