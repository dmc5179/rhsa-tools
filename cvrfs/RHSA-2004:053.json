Isag is a utility for\ngraphically displaying these statistics.\nA bug was found in the Red Hat sysstat package post and trigger scripts,\nwhich used insecure temporary file names. A local attacker could overwrite\nsystem files using carefully-crafted symbolic links in the /tmp directory.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-0107 to this issue.\nWhile fixing this issue, a flaw was discovered in the isag utility, which\nalso used insecure temporary file names. A local attacker could overwrite\nfiles that the user running isag has write access to using\ncarefully-crafted symbolic links in the /tmp directory.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0108 to this issue.\nOther issues addressed in this advisory include:\n* iostat -x should return all partitions on the system (up to a maximum of\n1024)\n* sar should handle network device names with more than 8 characters properly\n* mpstat should work correctly with more than 7 CPUs as well as generate\ncorrect statistics when accessing individual CPUs.  This issue only\naffected Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1\n* The sysstat package was not built with the proper dependencies;\ntherefore, it was possible that isag could not be run because the necessary\ntools were not available.  Therefore, isag was split off into its own\nsubpackage with the required dependencies in place.  This issue only\naffects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.\nUsers of sysstat and isag should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain patches to correct these issues.\nNOTE: In order to use isag on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, you must\ninstall the sysstat-isag package after upgrading.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
