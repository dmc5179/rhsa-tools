If too many connections were opened in a short period of time,\nall system memory and swap space would be consumed by httpd, negatively\nimpacting other processes, or causing a system crash. (CVE-2008-1678)\nNote: The CVE-2008-1678 issue did not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5\nprior to 5.3. The problem was introduced via the RHBA-2009:0181 errata in\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3, which upgraded OpenSSL to the newer 0.9.8e\nversion.\nA flaw was found in the handling of the \"Options\" and \"AllowOverride\"\ndirectives. In configurations using the \"AllowOverride\" directive with\ncertain \"Options=\" arguments, local users were not restricted from\nexecuting commands from a Server-Side-Include script as intended.\n(CVE-2009-1195)\nAll httpd users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues. Users must restart httpd for\nthis update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
