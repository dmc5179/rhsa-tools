If a\nmalicious local user has write access to the directory wget is saving a\nfile into, it is possible to overwrite files that the user running wget\nhas write access to. (CAN-2004-2014)\nA bug was found in the way wget filters redirection URLs. It is possible\nfor a malicious Web server to overwrite files the user running wget has\nwrite access to. Note: in order for this attack to succeed the local\nDNS would need to resolve \"..\" to an IP address, which is an unlikely\nsituation.  (CAN-2004-1487)\nA bug was found in the way wget displays HTTP response codes. It is\npossible that a malicious web server could inject a specially crafted\nterminal escape sequence capable of misleading the user running wget.\n(CAN-2004-1488)\nUsers should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a version of\nwget that is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
