Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains\nthe\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2001:097"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["New squid packages are available for Red Hat Linux 7.0 that fix a possible\nsecurity problem with Squid's HTTP accelerator feature. If Squid was\nconfigured in accelerator-only mode, it was possible for remote users\nto portscan machines through the Squid proxy, potentially allowing for\naccess to machines not otherwise available.\nIt is recommended that users who use Squid in accelerator-only mode update\nto the fixed packages. Note that Red Hat Linux 7.1 is not affected by this\nvulnerability, nor are releases prior to Red Hat Linux 7.0.","If Squid is configured with 'httpd_accel_host <some hostname>' and\n'httpd_accel_with_proxy off', access control lists will not be enabled.\nThis could allow any remote user to use the squid server to access other\nsites, potentially ones that they could not reach otherwise.\nThanks go to Paul Nasrat <pnasrat@uk.now.com> for notifying us of this\nvulnerability and to the Squid team for providing the patch.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
