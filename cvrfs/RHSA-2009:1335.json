Datagram TLS (DTLS) is a protocol\nbased on TLS that is capable of securing datagram transport (for example,\nUDP).\nMultiple denial of service flaws were discovered in OpenSSL's DTLS\nimplementation. A remote attacker could use these flaws to cause a DTLS\nserver to use excessive amounts of memory, or crash on an invalid memory\naccess or NULL pointer dereference. (CVE-2009-1377, CVE-2009-1378,\nCVE-2009-1379, CVE-2009-1386, CVE-2009-1387)\nNote: These flaws only affect applications that use DTLS. Red Hat does not\nship any DTLS client or server applications in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\nAn input validation flaw was found in the handling of the BMPString and\nUniversalString ASN1 string types in OpenSSL's ASN1_STRING_print_ex()\nfunction. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially-crafted\nX.509 certificate that could cause applications using the affected function\nto crash when printing certificate contents. (CVE-2009-0590)\nNote: The affected function is rarely used. No application shipped with Red\nHat Enterprise Linux calls this function, for example.\nThese updated packages also fix the following bugs:\n* \"openssl smime -verify -in\" verifies the signature of the input file and\nthe \"-verify\" switch expects a signed or encrypted input file. Previously,\nrunning openssl on an S/MIME file that was not encrypted or signed caused\nopenssl to segfault. With this update, the input file is now checked for a\nsignature or encryption. Consequently, openssl now returns an error and\nquits when attempting to verify an unencrypted or unsigned S/MIME file.\n(BZ#472440)\n* when generating RSA keys, pairwise tests were called even in non-FIPS\nmode. This prevented small keys from being generated. With this update,\ngenerating keys in non-FIPS mode no longer calls the pairwise tests and\nkeys as small as 32-bits can be generated in this mode. Note: In FIPS mode,\npairwise tests are still called and keys generated in this mode must still\nbe 1024-bits or larger. (BZ#479817)\nAs well, these updated packages add the following enhancements:\n* both the libcrypto and libssl shared libraries, which are part of the\nOpenSSL FIPS module, are now checked for integrity on initialization of\nFIPS mode. (BZ#475798)\n* an issuing Certificate Authority (CA) allows multiple certificate\ntemplates to inherit the CA's Common Name (CN). Because this CN is used as\na unique identifier, each template had to have its own Certificate\nRevocation List (CRL). With this update, multiple CRLs with the same\nsubject name can now be stored in a X509_STORE structure, with their\nsignature field being used to distinguish between them. (BZ#457134)\n* the fipscheck library is no longer needed for rebuilding the openssl\nsource RPM. (BZ#475798)\nOpenSSL users should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve these\nissues and add these enhancements.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
