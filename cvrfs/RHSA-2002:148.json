This behavior could\nallow local users to gain root privileges by writing a Trojan horse library\nand getting the root user to run mkpasswd.\nThe tcl/tk package searched for its libraries in the current working\ndirectory before other directories, which could allow local users to\nexecute arbitrary code by writing Trojan horse library that is under a\nuser-controlled directory.\nThese issues affect Red Hat Linux versions 7 and 7.1, they were fixed\nin later Red Hat releases.\nAll users should upgrade to the errata packages which are not vulnerable to\nthese issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
