This could allow arbitrary code to be run\non the server as the user the Apache children are set to run as.\nAll users of Stronghold are advised to patch or upgrade their servers.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
