A local user could make use of this\nflaw to gain elevated (root) privileges.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1235 to\nthis issue.\nA flaw was discovered where an executable could cause a VMA overlap leading\nto a crash.  A local user could trigger this flaw by creating a carefully\ncrafted a.out binary on 32-bit systems or a carefully crafted ELF binary\non Itanium systems.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0003 to this issue.\niSEC Security Research discovered a flaw in the page fault handler code\nthat could lead to local users gaining elevated (root) privileges on\nmultiprocessor machines.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0001 to this issue. A patch\nthat coincidentally fixed this issue was committed to the Update 4 kernel\nrelease in December 2004.  Therefore Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 kernels\nprovided by RHBA-2004:550 and subsequent updates are not vulnerable to\nthis issue.\nA flaw in the system call filtering code in the audit subsystem included\nin Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 allowed a local user to cause a crash when\nauditing was enabled.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1237 to this issue.\nOlaf Kirch discovered that the recent security fixes for cmsg_len handling\n(CAN-2004-1016) broke 32-bit compatibility on 64-bit platforms such as\nAMD64 and Intel EM64T. A patch to correct this issue is included.\nA recent Internet Draft by Fernando Gont recommended that ICMP Source\nQuench messages be ignored by hosts.  A patch to ignore these messages is\nincluded.\nNote: The kernel-unsupported package contains various drivers and modules\nthat are unsupported and therefore might contain security problems that\nhave not been addressed.\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 users are advised to upgrade their\nkernels to the packages associated with their machine architectures\nand configurations as listed in this erratum.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
