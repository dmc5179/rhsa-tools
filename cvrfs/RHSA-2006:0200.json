If a user visits a malicious web page, Firefox could\ncrash or execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the name CVE-2006-0292 to\nthis issue.\nmoz_bug_r_a4 discovered a bug in Firefox's XULDocument.persist() function.\nA malicious web page could inject arbitrary RDF data into a user's\nlocalstore.rdf file, which can cause Firefox to execute arbitrary\njavascript when a user runs Firefox.  (CVE-2006-0296)\nA denial of service bug was found in the way Firefox saves history\ninformation. If a user visits a web page with a very long title, it is\npossible Firefox will crash or take a very long time the next time it is\nrun. (CVE-2005-4134)\nThis update also fixes a bug when using XSLT to transform documents.\nPassing DOM Nodes as parameters to functions expecting an xsl:param could\ncause Firefox to throw an exception. \nUsers of Firefox are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
