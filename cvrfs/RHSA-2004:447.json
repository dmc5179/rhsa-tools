An attacker could\ncreate a carefully crafted BMP file which would cause an application\nto enter an infinite loop and not respond to user input when the file was\nopened by a victim.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0753 to this issue.\nDuring a security audit, Chris Evans discovered a stack and a heap overflow\nin the XPM image decoder. An attacker could create a carefully crafted XPM\nfile which could cause an application linked with gtk2 to crash or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code when the file was opened by a victim.\n(CAN-2004-0782, CAN-2004-0783)\nChris Evans also discovered an integer overflow in the ICO image decoder.\nAn attacker could create a carefully crafted ICO file which could cause an\napplication linked with gtk2 to crash when the file is opened by a victim.\n(CAN-2004-0788)\nThese packages have also been updated to correct a bug which caused the xpm\nloader to fail.\nUsers of gdk-pixbuf are advised to upgrade to these packages, which\ncontain backported patches and are not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
