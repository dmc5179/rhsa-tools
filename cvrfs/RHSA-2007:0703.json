These\npackages include the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and\nserver.\nA flaw was found in the way the ssh server wrote account names to the\naudit subsystem. An attacker could inject strings containing parts of audit\nmessages which could possibly mislead or confuse audit log parsing tools.\n(CVE-2007-3102)\nA flaw was found in the way the OpenSSH server processes GSSAPI\nauthentication requests. When GSSAPI authentication was enabled in OpenSSH\nserver, a remote attacker may have been able to determine if a username is\nvalid. (CVE-2006-5052)\nThe following bugs were also fixed:\n* the ssh daemon did not generate audit messages when an ssh session was\nclosed.\n* GSSAPI authentication sometimes failed on clusters using DNS or\nload-balancing.\n* the sftp client and server leaked small amounts of memory in some cases.\n* the sftp client didn't properly exit and return non-zero status in batch\nmode when the destination disk drive was full.\n* when restarting the ssh daemon with the initscript, the ssh daemon was\nsometimes not restarted successfully because the old running ssh daemon was\nnot properly killed.\n* with challenge/response authentication enabled, the pam sub-process was\nnot terminated if the user authentication timed out.\nAll users of openssh should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
