BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver\nlibrary (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and\ntools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.\nMichael Sinatra discovered that BIND was incorrectly caching responses\nwithout performing proper DNSSEC validation, when those responses were\nreceived during the resolution of a recursive client query that requested\nDNSSEC records but indicated that checking should be disabled. A remote\nattacker could use this flaw to bypass the DNSSEC validation check and\nperform a cache poisoning attack if the target BIND server was receiving\nsuch client queries. (CVE-2009-4022)\nAll BIND users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing the\nupdate, the BIND daemon (named) will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
