Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,\nwhich give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability\nfrom the CVE links in the References section.","Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.\nSeveral flaws were found in the processing of malformed HTML mail content.\nAn HTML mail message containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird\nto crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nuser running Thunderbird. (CVE-2009-2462, CVE-2009-2463, CVE-2009-2466,\nCVE-2009-3072, CVE-2009-3075, CVE-2009-3380, CVE-2009-3979, CVE-2010-0159)\nA use-after-free flaw was found in Thunderbird. An attacker could use this\nflaw to crash Thunderbird or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2009-3077)\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the Thunderbird string to\nfloating point conversion routines. An HTML mail message containing\nmalicious JavaScript could crash Thunderbird or, potentially, execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird.\n(CVE-2009-0689)\nA use-after-free flaw was found in Thunderbird. Under low memory\nconditions, viewing an HTML mail message containing malicious content could\nresult in Thunderbird executing arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nuser running Thunderbird. (CVE-2009-1571)\nA flaw was found in the way Thunderbird created temporary file names for\ndownloaded files. If a local attacker knows the name of a file Thunderbird\nis going to download, they can replace the contents of that file with\narbitrary contents. (CVE-2009-3274)\nA flaw was found in the way Thunderbird displayed a right-to-left override\ncharacter when downloading a file. In these cases, the name displayed in\nthe title bar differed from the name displayed in the dialog body. An\nattacker could use this flaw to trick a user into downloading a file that\nhas a file name or extension that is different from what the user expected.\n(CVE-2009-3376)\nA flaw was found in the way Thunderbird processed SOCKS5 proxy replies. A\nmalicious SOCKS5 server could send a specially-crafted reply that would\ncause Thunderbird to crash. (CVE-2009-2470)\nDescriptions in the dialogs when adding and removing PKCS #11 modules were\nnot informative. An attacker able to trick a user into installing a\nmalicious PKCS #11 module could use this flaw to install their own\nCertificate Authority certificates on a user's machine, making it possible\nto trick the user into believing they are viewing trusted content or,\npotentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\nThunderbird. (CVE-2009-3076)\nAll Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which\nresolves these issues. All running instances of Thunderbird must be\nrestarted for the update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
