It is possible\nthat Web content could generate events such as keystrokes or mouse clicks\nthat could be used to steal data or execute malicious Javascript code. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2005-2260 to this issue. \nA bug was found in the way Mozilla executed Javascript in XBL controls. It\nis possible for a malicious webpage to leverage this vulnerability to\nexecute other JavaScript based attacks even when JavaScript is disabled.\n(CAN-2005-2261) \nA bug was found in the way Mozilla installed its extensions. If a user can\nbe tricked into visiting a malicious webpage, it may be possible to obtain\nsensitive information such as cookies or passwords. (CAN-2005-2263)\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla handled certain Javascript functions. It\nis possible for a malicious webpage to crash the browser by executing\nmalformed Javascript code. (CAN-2005-2265)\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla handled multiple frame domains. It is\npossible for a frame as part of a malicious website to inject content into\na frame that belongs to another domain. This issue was previously fixed as\nCAN-2004-0718 but was accidentally disabled. (CAN-2005-1937) \nA bug was found in the way Mozilla handled child frames. It is possible for\na malicious framed page to steal sensitive information from its parent\npage. (CAN-2005-2266)\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla opened URLs from media players. If a\nmedia player opens a URL which is Javascript, the Javascript executes\nwith access to the currently open webpage. (CAN-2005-2267)\nA design flaw was found in the way Mozilla displayed alerts and prompts.\nAlerts and prompts were given the generic title [JavaScript Application]\nwhich prevented a user from knowing which site created them. (CAN-2005-2268)\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla handled DOM node names. It is possible\nfor a malicious site to overwrite a DOM node name, allowing certain\nprivileged chrome actions to execute the malicious Javascript. (CAN-2005-2269)\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla cloned base objects. It is possible for\nWeb content to traverse the prototype chain to gain access to privileged\nchrome objects. (CAN-2005-2270)\nUsers of Mozilla are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain Mozilla version 1.7.10 and are not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
