Two\nvulnerabilities have been found in versions of VNC shipped by Red Hat.\nThe VNC server acts as an X server, but the script for starting it\ngenerates an MIT X cookie (which is used for X authentication) without\nusing a sufficiently strong random number generator.  This could allow an\nattacker to more easily guess the authentication cookie.\nThe VNC DES authentication scheme is implemented using a challenge-response\narchitecture, producing a random and different challenge for each\nauthentication attempt. A bug in the function for generating the random\nchallenge caused the random seed to be reset to the current time on every\nauthentication attempt. Therefore, two authentication attempts within the\nsame second could receive the same challenge.  An eavesdropper could\nexploit this vulnerability by replaying the response, thereby gaining\nauthentication.\nAll users of VNC are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain patches to correct these issues.\nNote that when using VNC on an untrusted network, always make sure to\ntunnel it through a secure authenticated protocol such as SSH.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
