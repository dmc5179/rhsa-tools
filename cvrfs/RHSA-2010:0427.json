Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,\nwhich give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability\nfrom the CVE links in the References section.","PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system\n(DBMS). PL/Perl and PL/Tcl allow users to write PostgreSQL functions in the\nPerl and Tcl languages, and are installed in trusted mode by default. In\ntrusted mode, certain operations, such as operating system level access,\nare restricted.\nA flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL enforced permission checks on\nscripts written in PL/Perl. If the PL/Perl procedural language was\nregistered on a particular database, an authenticated database user running\na specially-crafted PL/Perl script could use this flaw to bypass intended\nPL/Perl trusted mode restrictions, allowing them to run arbitrary Perl\nscripts with the privileges of the database server. (CVE-2010-1169)\nRed Hat would like to thank Tim Bunce for responsibly reporting the\nCVE-2010-1169 flaw.\nA flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL enforced permission checks on\nscripts written in PL/Tcl. If the PL/Tcl procedural language was registered\non a particular database, an authenticated database user running a\nspecially-crafted PL/Tcl script could use this flaw to bypass intended\nPL/Tcl trusted mode restrictions, allowing them to run arbitrary Tcl\nscripts with the privileges of the database server. (CVE-2010-1170)\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL retrieved a\nsubstring from the bit string for BIT() and BIT VARYING() SQL data types.\nAn authenticated database user running a specially-crafted SQL query could\nuse this flaw to cause a temporary denial of service (postgres daemon\ncrash) or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\ndatabase server. (CVE-2010-0442)\nAn integer overflow flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL used to calculate\nthe size of the hash table for joined relations. An authenticated database\nuser could create a specially-crafted SQL query which could cause a\ntemporary denial of service (postgres daemon crash) or, potentially,\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of the database server.\n(CVE-2010-0733)\nPostgreSQL improperly protected session-local state during the execution of\nan index function by a database superuser during the database maintenance\noperations. An authenticated database user could use this flaw to elevate\ntheir privileges via specially-crafted index functions. (CVE-2009-4136)\nAll PostgreSQL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain backported patches to correct these issues. Running\nPostgreSQL instances must be restarted (\"service rhdb restart\") for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
