This meant that containers running on a FIPS mode kernel would not enable FIPS mode without the crypto policy being changed. With this update, OpenJDK queries the NSS library as to whether FIPS mode is active or not. (RHBZ#2014201)\n* The use of the NSS FIPS mode by OpenJDK requires the JDK to login to the NSS software token. Previously, this happened indirectly as part of some crypto operations, but not others. With this update, the JDK logs in to the token on initialisation. (RHBZ#2014204)\n* While in FIPS mode, the NSS Software Token does not allow the import of private or secret plain keys. This caused the OpenJDK keytool application to fail when used with OpenJDK in FIPS mode. With this update, OpenJDK will now import such keys into the NSS database. This behaviour may be disabled using -Dcom.redhat.fips.plainKeySupport=false.
