On sites\nwhere the server-status page is publicly accessible and ExtendedStatus is\nenabled this could lead to a cross-site scripting attack. On Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux the server-status page is not enabled by default and it is\nbest practice to not make this publicly available. (CVE-2006-5752)\nA flaw was found in the Apache HTTP Server mod_cache module. On sites where\ncaching is enabled, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted\nrequest that would cause the Apache child process handling that request to\ncrash. This could lead to a denial of service if using a threaded\nMulti-Processing Module. (CVE-2007-1863)\nIn addition, two bugs were fixed:\n* when the ProxyErrorOverride directive was enabled, responses with 3xx\nstatus-codes would be overriden at the proxy. This has been changed so that\nonly 4xx and 5xx responses are overriden.\n* the \"ProxyTimeout\" directive was not inherited across virtual host\ndefinitions.\nUsers of httpd should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues. Users should restart Apache\nafter installing this update.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
