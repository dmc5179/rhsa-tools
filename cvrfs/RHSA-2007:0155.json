A remote attacker could cause the PHP interpreter to crash by\nsubmitting an input variable with a deeply nested array. (CVE-2007-1285) \nA flaw was found in the way PHP's unserialize() function processed data. If\na remote attacker was able to pass arbitrary data to PHP's unserialize()\nfunction, they could possibly execute arbitrary code as the apache user.\n(CVE-2007-1286)\nA flaw was found in the way the mbstring extension set global variables. A\nscript which used the mb_parse_str() function to set global variables could\nbe forced to enable the register_globals configuration option, possibly\nresulting in global variable injection. (CVE-2007-1583)\nA double free flaw was found in PHP's session_decode() function. If a\nremote attacker was able to pass arbitrary data to PHP's session_decode()\nfunction, they could possibly execute arbitrary code as the apache user.\n(CVE-2007-1711)\nA flaw was discovered in the way PHP's mail() function processed header\ndata. If a script sent mail using a Subject header containing a string from\nan untrusted source, a remote attacker could send bulk e-mail to unintended\nrecipients. (CVE-2007-1718)\nA heap based buffer overflow flaw was discovered in PHP's gd extension. A\nscript that could be forced to process WBMP images from an untrusted source\ncould result in arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2007-1001)\nA buffer over-read flaw was discovered in PHP's gd extension. A script that\ncould be forced to write arbitrary string using a JIS font from an\nuntrusted source could cause the PHP interpreter to crash. (CVE-2007-0455)\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
