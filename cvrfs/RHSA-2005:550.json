This\nincludes the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and server. \nA bug was found in the way the OpenSSH server handled the MaxStartups and\nLoginGraceTime configuration variables. A malicious user could connect to\nthe SSH daemon in such a way that it would prevent additional logins from\noccuring until the malicious connections are closed. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-2069 to this issue.\nAdditionally, the following issues are resolved with this update:\n- The -q option of the ssh client did not suppress the banner message sent\nby the server, which caused errors when used in scripts.\n- The sshd daemon failed to close the client connection if multiple X\nclients were forwarded over the connection and the client session exited.\n- The sftp client leaked memory if used for extended periods.\n- The sshd daemon called the PAM functions incorrectly if the user was\nunknown on the system.\nAll users of openssh should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches and resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
