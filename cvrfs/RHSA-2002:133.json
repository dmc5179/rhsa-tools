Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2002:133"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Important","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Various versions of the ISC BIND resolver libraries are vulnerable to a\nbuffer overflow attack.  Updated BIND packages are now available to fix\nthis issue.","ISC BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) is an implementation of the DNS\n(Domain Name System) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named),\nwhich resolves host names to IP addresses; a resolver library\n(routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and\nvarious tools.\nA buffer overflow vulnerability exists in multiple implementations of DNS\nresolver libraries.  Applications that utilize vulnerable DNS resolver\nlibraries may be affected.  A remote attacker who is able to send malicious\nDNS responses could potentially exploit this vulnerability to execute\narbitrary code or cause a denial of service on a vulnerable system. \nRed Hat Linux does not ship with any applications or libraries that link \nagainst the BIND resolver libraries; however, third party code may be affected.\nThe updated bind packages included in this errata contain the patches from\n8.3.3 which fix the buffer overflow applied (backported) to the 9.2.1 sources.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
