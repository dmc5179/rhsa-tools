It was possible for an attacker behind the Squid proxy\nto issue a malformed TRACE request, crashing the Squid daemon child\nprocess. As long as these requests were sent, it would prevent\nlegitimate usage of the proxy server. (CVE-2007-1560)\nThis flaw does not affect the version of Squid shipped in Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 2.1, 3, or 4.\nUsers of Squid should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a\nbackported patch and is not vulnerable to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
