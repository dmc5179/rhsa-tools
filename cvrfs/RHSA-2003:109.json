Balsa is a GNOME email client which\nincludes code from Mutt.\nA potential buffer overflow in Mutt version 1.4 exists when parsing mailbox\nnames returned by an IMAP server. It is possible that a hostile IMAP server\ncould cause arbitrary code to be executed by the user running Mutt.  This\nissue affects versions of Mutt provided with Red Hat Linux 8.0 and Red Hat\nLinux 9.\nVersions 1.2 and higher of Balsa incorporate the vulnerable Mutt IMAP code\nand are therefore vulnerable to this issue as well.  It is possible that a\nhostile IMAP server could cause arbitrary code to be executed by the user\nrunning Balsa.  This issue affects Red Hat Linux 7.2, 7.3, 8.0 and 9.\nAdditionally, a buffer overflow in libesmtp, an SMTP library used by Balsa,\nbefore version 0.8.11 allows a hostile remote SMTP server to execute\narbitrary code via a certain response or cause a denial of service via long\nserver responses.  This issue only affects versions of libesmtp provided by\nRed Hat Linux 7.2 and 7.3.\nUsers of Mutt and Balsa are recommended to update to these erratum packages\ncontaining updated versions of Mutt, Balsa, and libesmtp which are not\nvulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
