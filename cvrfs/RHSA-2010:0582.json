Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.","Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer\nPages (JSP) technologies.\nA flaw was found in the way Tomcat handled the Transfer-Encoding header in\nHTTP requests. A specially-crafted HTTP request could prevent Tomcat from\nsending replies, or cause Tomcat to return truncated replies, or replies\ncontaining data related to the requests of other users, for all subsequent\nHTTP requests. (CVE-2010-2227)\nTwo directory traversal flaws were found in the Tomcat deployment process.\nA specially-crafted WAR file could, when deployed, cause a file to be\ncreated outside of the web root into any directory writable by the Tomcat\nuser, or could lead to the deletion of files in the Tomcat host's work\ndirectory. (CVE-2009-2693, CVE-2009-2902)\nUsers of Tomcat should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues. Tomcat must be restarted for\nthis update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
