A remote attacker who is able to\nconnect to the directory server could send malicious requests which would\ncause the server to crash, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2006-0451,\nCVE-2006-0452, CVE-2006-0453)\nThis update also addresses the following issues:\n* 173687 - When the Directory Server's effective user and the real user \nare different, there was a small window that creates log files owned by\nthe real user, which should be owned by the effective user.\n* 175063 - When an ldif file contains an entry with the dn that includes\nescaped double quotes, importing the entry could fail and the\nentry is skipped. The following reindex fails due to the skip.\n* 175897 - There was a problem in evaluating the intersection of multiple\nrange searches when the attribute of each range search is different from\neach other. \nFor example: \n&(attr1 <= val1)(attr2 >= val2)  \nThis issue has been fixed.\n* 185477 - In previous 7.X versions of Red Hat Directory Server, importing\na malformed parent entry and some child entries resulted in the child\nentries being successfully added without a parent.\n* 184585 - The server did not allow a re-bind using SASL on the same\nconnection, returning error 49.\n* 185765 - The password sync tool leaked memory.\n* 181827 - Deleting an attribute value by trimming it's value to an empty\nstring in Active Directory did not sync to Red Hat Directory Server. This\nissue has been fixed. \n* 186657 - Sustained heavy password modification load on the Active\nDirectory side could potentially crash passsync.exe. This issue has been\nfixed.\nUsers are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which resolves these\nissues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
