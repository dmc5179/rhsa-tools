An\nunauthenticated remote attacker could use these flaws to trigger high\nmemory consumption in the Directory Server, possibly causing it to crash or\nterminate unexpectedly when the server ran out of available memory.\n(CVE-2008-3283)\nUlf Weltman of Hewlett-Packard discovered a flaw in the way Directory\nServer handled LDAP search requests with patterns. A remote attacker with\naccess to the LDAP service could create a search request that, when the\nsearch pattern was matched against specially crafted data records, caused\nDirectory Server to use a large amount of CPU time. Directory Server did\nnot impose time limits on such search requests. In this updated package,\nDirectory Server imposes a configurable limit on the pattern-search query\nrun time, with the default limit set to 30 seconds. (CVE-2008-2930)\nIn addition to these security fixes, the following bugs have been fixed in\nthese updated packages:\n* The change sequence numbers in multi-master replication had a built-in\ntime skew to accommodate differences in the clocks on master servers. Under\ncertain circumstances, this skew exceeded the maximum allowable skew,\ncausing replication to stop entirely.\n* If an entry with a large attribute value, such as over 32KB, was\nreplicated, the replication could fail with a DB_BUFFER_SMALL error. \n* If a password policy attribute such as accountunlocktime was added to an\nentry, the server would attempt to replicate that attribute, causing\nreplication to fail. \n* In replication scenarios, if an attribute value was scheduled to be\ndeleted and also was indexed or had an attribute subtype which was indexed,\nthe Directory Server would crash during the index operation.\n* On x86_64 systems, recursively adding groups as members to other groups \ncould crash the server because the stack size for the memberOf plug-in on \n64-bit systems was hard-coded to 256KB, regardless of the ulimit value.\n* A problem in the SASL IO handling meant that memory was not reallocated\nafter SASL binds. For example, a simple bind coming immediately after a\nSASL bind might have failed.\nAll users of Red Hat Directory Server 8.0 should upgrade to these updated\npackages, which resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
