These\nvulnerabilities are summarized on the Adobe Security Advisory APSB10-02\npage listed in the References section. A specially-crafted PDF file could\ncause Adobe Reader to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the\nuser running Adobe Reader when opened. (CVE-2009-4324, CVE-2009-3953,\nCVE-2009-3954, CVE-2009-3955, CVE-2009-3959, CVE-2009-3956)\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n* the acroread process continued to run even after closing a PDF file. If\nmultiple PDF files were opened and then closed, the acroread processes\ncontinued to run and consume system resources (up to 100% CPU usage). With\nthis update, the acroread process correctly exits, which resolves this\nissue. (BZ#473217)\n* the PPKLite.api plug-in was missing, causing Adobe Reader to crash when\nattempting to open signed PDF files. For such files, if an immediate crash\nwas not observed, clicking on the Signature Panel could trigger one. With\nthis update, the PPKLite.api plug-in is included, which resolves this\nissue. (BZ#472975)\n* Adobe Reader has been upgraded to version 9.3. (BZ#497957)\nAdobe have discontinued support for Adobe Reader 8 for Linux. All users of\nAdobe Reader are advised to install these updated packages, which contain\nAdobe Reader version 9.3, which is not vulnerable to these issues and fixes\nthese bugs. All running instances of Adobe Reader must be restarted for the\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
