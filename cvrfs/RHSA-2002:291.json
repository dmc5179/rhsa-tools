The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-1356 to\nthis issue.\nUsers of Ethereal should update to the errata packages containing Ethereal\nversion 0.9.8 which is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
