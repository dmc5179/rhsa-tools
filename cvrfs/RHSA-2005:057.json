An attacker could construct a\ncarefully crafted PDF file that could cause GPdf to crash or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code when opened. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1125 to\nthis issue.\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the Decrypt::makeFileKey2 function of\nXpdf which also affects GPdf due to a shared codebase. An attacker could\nconstruct a carefully crafted PDF file that could cause GPdf to crash or\npossibly execute arbitrary code when opened. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0064 to\nthis issue.\nDuring a source code audit, Chris Evans and others discovered a number of\ninteger overflow bugs that affected all versions of Xpdf, which also\naffects GPdf due to a shared codebase. An attacker could construct a\ncarefully crafted PDF file that could cause GPdf to crash or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code when opened.  This issue was assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0888 by The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org). Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 contained a fix for this issue,\nbut it was found to be incomplete and left 64-bit architectures vulnerable.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2005-0206 to this issue.\nUsers should update to this erratum package which contains backported\npatches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
