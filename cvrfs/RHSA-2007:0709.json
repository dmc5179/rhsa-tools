It was possible for\nWireshark to crash or stop responding if it read a malformed packet off the\nnetwork. (CVE-2007-3389, CVE-2007-3390, CVE-2007-3391, CVE-2007-3392,\nCVE-2007-3393)\nWireshark would interpret certain completion codes incorrectly when\ndissecting IPMI traffic. Additionally, IPMI 2.0 packets would be reported\nas malformed IPMI traffic.\nUsers of Wireshark should upgrade to these updated packages containing\nWireshark version 0.99.6, which correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
