A flaw was\nfound in the handling of the epsf command used to insert inline EPS files\ninto a document. An attacker could create a carefully crafted ASCII file\nwhich made use of the epsf pipe command in such a way that it could execute\narbitrary commands if the file was opened with enscript by a victim. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2004-1184 to this issue.\nAdditional flaws in Enscript were also discovered which can only be\ntriggered by executing enscript with carefully crafted command line\narguments. These flaws therefore only have a security impact if enscript\nis executed by other programs and passed untrusted data from remote users.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the names CAN-2004-1185 and CAN-2004-1186 to these issues.\nAll users of enscript should upgrade to these updated packages, which\nresolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
