This is triggered if optional\nrenegotiation is used (SSLOptions +OptRenegotiate) along with verification\nof client certificates and a change to the cipher suite over the\nrenegotiation.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0192 to this issue.\nYoshioka Tsuneo found that unpatched versions of Apache 2 versions 2.0.35\nto 2.0.46 have a bug that can cause a remote Denial of Service. When a\nclient requests that proxy ftp connect to a ftp server with an IPv6\naddress, and the proxy is unable to create an IPv6 socket, an infinite loop\noccurs.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the\nname CAN-2003-0254 to this issue.\nSaheed Akhtar found that unpatched Apache 2 versions 2.0.35 through 2.0.46\nhave a bug in the prefork MPM when handling accept errors. In a server with\nmultiple listening sockets, a certain error returned by accept() on a\nrarely-accessed port can cause a temporary denial of service.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name CAN-2003-0253\nto this issue.\nIt is possible for Apache 2 to get into an infinite loop handling internal\nredirects and nested subrequests. A patch for this issue adds the new\nLimitInternalRecursion directive.\nAll users of the Apache HTTP Web Server are advised to upgrade to the\napplicable errata packages, which contain back-ported fixes correcting\nthese issues, and are applied to Apache version 2.0.40.\nAfter the errata packages are installed, restart the Web service by running\n(as root) the following command:\n/sbin/service httpd restart","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
