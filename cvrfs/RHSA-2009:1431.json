A web\npage containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,\npotentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\nSeaMonkey. (CVE-2009-3072, CVE-2009-3075)\nA use-after-free flaw was found in SeaMonkey. An attacker could use this\nflaw to crash SeaMonkey or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2009-3077)\nDescriptions in the dialogs when adding and removing PKCS #11 modules were\nnot informative. An attacker able to trick a user into installing a\nmalicious PKCS #11 module could use this flaw to install their own\nCertificate Authority certificates on a user's machine, making it possible\nto trick the user into believing they are viewing a trusted site or,\npotentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\nSeaMonkey. (CVE-2009-3076)\nA flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey displays the address bar when\nwindow.open() is called in a certain way. An attacker could use this flaw\nto conceal a malicious URL, possibly tricking a user into believing they\nare viewing a trusted site. (CVE-2009-2654)\nAll SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct\nthese issues. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for\nthe changes to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
