Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003:021"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Moderate","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated packages fix a vulnerability found in the Kerberos FTP client\ndistributed with the Red Hat Linux Advanced Server krb5 packages.\n[Updated 06 Feb 2003]\nAdded fixed packages for Advanced Workstation 2.1.  For Advanced\nWorkstation 2.1 these packages also fix CAN-2002-1235 as described in\nRHSA-2002:250.","Kerberos is a network authentication system.\nA problem has been found in the Kerberos FTP client. When retrieving a\nfile with a name beginning with a pipe character, the FTP client will\npass the file name to the command shell in a system() call. This could\nallow a malicious FTP server to write to files outside of the current\ndirectory or execute commands as the user running the FTP client.\nThe Kerberos FTP client runs as the default FTP client when the Kerberos\npackage krb5-workstation is installed on a Red Hat Linux Advanced Server\ndistribution.\nAll users of Kerberos are advised to upgrade to these errata packages which\ncontain a backported patch and are not vulnerable to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
