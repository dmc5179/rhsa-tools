Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give\ndetailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the\nCVE links in the References section.","Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java\napplications based on JBoss Application Server 7.\nIt was found that a prior countermeasure in Apache WSS4J for\nBleichenbacher's attack on XML Encryption (CVE-2011-2487) threw an\nexception that permitted an attacker to determine the failure of the\nattempted attack, thereby leaving WSS4J vulnerable to the attack.\nThe original flaw allowed a remote attacker to recover the entire plain\ntext form of a symmetric key. (CVE-2015-0226)\nA flaw was found in the way PicketLink's Service Provider and Identity\nProvider handled certain requests. A remote attacker could use this flaw to\nlog to a victim's account via PicketLink. (CVE-2015-0277)\nIt was discovered that a JkUnmount rule for a subtree of a previous JkMount\nrule could be ignored. This could allow a remote attacker to potentially\naccess a private artifact in a tree that would otherwise not be accessible\nto them. (CVE-2014-8111)\nIt was discovered that OpenSSL would accept ephemeral RSA keys when using\nnon-export RSA cipher suites. A malicious server could make a TLS/SSL\nclient using OpenSSL use a weaker key exchange method. (CVE-2015-0204)\nIt was found that Apache WSS4J permitted bypass of the\nrequireSignedEncryptedDataElements configuration property via XML Signature\nwrapping attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to modify the\ncontents of a signed request. (CVE-2015-0227)\nIt was found that OpenSSL's BigNumber Squaring implementation could produce\nincorrect results under certain special conditions. This flaw could\npossibly affect certain OpenSSL library functionality, such as RSA\nblinding. Note that this issue occurred rarely and with a low probability,\nand there is currently no known way of exploiting it. (CVE-2014-3570)\nIt was found that the Command Line Interface, as provided by Red Hat\nEnterprise Application Platform, created a history file named\n.jboss-cli-history in the user's home directory with insecure default file\npermissions. This could allow a malicious local user to gain information\notherwise not accessible to them. (CVE-2014-3586)\nThe CVE-2015-0277 issue was discovered by Ondrej Kotek of Red Hat.\nThis release of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform also includes bug\nfixes and enhancements. Documentation for these changes will be available\nshortly from the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.0 Release Notes,\nlinked to in the References.\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.3 as provided\nfrom the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.\nThe JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
