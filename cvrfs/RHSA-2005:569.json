An attacker could create a carefully crafted compressed stream that\nwould cause an application to crash if the stream is opened by a user.  As\nan example, an attacker could create a malicious PNG image file which would\ncause a web browser or mail viewer to crash if the image is viewed.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the name\nCAN-2005-2096 to this issue.\nPlease note that the versions of Zlib as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux 2.1 and 3 are not vulnerable to this issue.\nAll users should update to these erratum packages which contain a patch\nfrom Mark Adler which corrects this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
