Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.

This errata release\ncorrects those problems.","The Net-SNMP project includes various Simple Network Management Protocol\n(SNMP) tools.\nThe SNMP daemon included in the Net-SNMP package versions 5.0.1 through\n5.0.4 can be caused to crash if it is sent a specially crafted packet.\nSuccessful exploitation of this issue would require knowledge of a known\nSNMP community string.\nRed Hat Linux 8.0 shipped with Net-SNMP 5.0.1 and is therefore vulnerable\nto this issue.  Users of Net-SNMP should upgrade to these errata packages\ncontaining Net-SNMP 5.0.6 which is not vulnerable to this issue.  In\naddition, Net-SNMP 5.0.6 fixes a number of other minor bugs.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
