Stop all KVM guest virtual machines.\n2. Either reboot the hypervisor machine or, as the root user, remove (using\n\"modprobe -r [module]\") and reload (using \"modprobe [module]\") all of the\nfollowing modules which are currently running (determined using \"lsmod\"):\nkvm, ksm, kvm-intel or kvm-amd.\n3.

KVM is a Linux kernel module built for\nthe standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.\nThe kvm_emulate_hypercall() implementation was missing a check for the\nCurrent Privilege Level (CPL). A local, unprivileged user in a virtual\nmachine could use this flaw to cause a local denial of service or escalate\ntheir privileges within that virtual machine. (CVE-2009-3290)\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n* non-maskable interrupts (NMI) were not supported on systems with AMD\nprocessors. As a consequence, Windows Server 2008 R2 guests running with\nmore than one virtual CPU assigned on systems with AMD processors would\nhang at the Windows shut down screen when a restart was attempted. This\nupdate adds support for NMI filtering on systems with AMD processors,\nallowing clean restarts of Windows Server 2008 R2 guests running with\nmultiple virtual CPUs. (BZ#520694)\n* significant performance issues for guests running 64-bit editions of\nWindows. This update improves performance for guests running 64-bit\neditions of Windows. (BZ#521793)\n* Windows guests may have experienced time drift. (BZ#521794)\n* removing the Red Hat VirtIO Ethernet Adapter from a guest running Windows\nServer 2008 R2 caused KVM to crash. With this update, device removal should\nnot cause this issue. (BZ#524557)\nAll KVM users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues. Note: The procedure in the\nSolution section must be performed before this update takes effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
