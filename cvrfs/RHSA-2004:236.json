Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.

The krb5_aname_to_localname function translates a\nKerberos principal name to a local account name, typically a UNIX username.\nThis function is frequently used when performing authorization checks.\nIf configured with mappings from particular Kerberos principals to\nparticular UNIX user names, certain functions called by\nkrb5_aname_to_localname will not properly check the lengths of buffers\nused to store portions of the principal name.  If configured to map\nprincipals to user names using rules, krb5_aname_to_localname would\nconsistently write one byte past the end of a buffer allocated from the\nheap.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-0523 to this issue.\nOnly configurations which enable the explicit mapping or rules-based\nmapping functionality of krb5_aname_to_localname() are vulnerable.\nThese configurations are not the default.\nUsers of Kerberos are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages which\ncontain backported security patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
