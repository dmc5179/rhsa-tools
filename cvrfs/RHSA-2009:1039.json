If ntpd was configured to use public key cryptography\nfor NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could use this flaw to\nsend a specially-crafted request packet that could crash ntpd.\n(CVE-2009-1252)\nNote: NTP authentication is not enabled by default.\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the ntpq diagnostic command. A\nmalicious, remote server could send a specially-crafted reply to an ntpq\nrequest that could crash ntpq. (CVE-2009-0159)\nAll ntp users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the\nupdate, the ntpd daemon will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
