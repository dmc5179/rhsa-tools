It consists of\nthe MySQL server daemon (mysqld) and many client programs and libraries.\nMySQL did not correctly check directories used as arguments for the DATA\nDIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY directives. Using this flaw, an authenticated\nattacker could elevate their access privileges to tables created by other\ndatabase users. Note: This attack does not work on existing tables. An\nattacker can only elevate their access to another user's tables as the\ntables are created. As well, the names of these created tables need to be\npredicted correctly for this attack to succeed. (CVE-2008-2079)\nA flaw was found in the way MySQL handles an empty bit-string literal. A\nremote, authenticated attacker could crash the MySQL server daemon (mysqld)\nif they used an empty bit-string literal in an SQL statement. This issue\nonly caused a temporary denial of service, as the MySQL daemon was\nautomatically restarted after the crash. (CVE-2008-3963)\nAn insufficient HTML entities quoting flaw was found in the mysql command\nline client's HTML output mode. If an attacker was able to inject arbitrary\nHTML tags into data stored in a MySQL database, which was later retrieved\nusing the mysql command line client and its HTML output mode, they could\nperform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against victims viewing the\nHTML output in a web browser. (CVE-2008-4456)\nMultiple format string flaws were found in the way the MySQL server logs\nuser commands when creating and deleting databases. A remote, authenticated\nattacker with permissions to CREATE and DROP databases could use these\nflaws to formulate a specifically-crafted SQL command that would cause a\ntemporary denial of service (open connections to mysqld are terminated).\n(CVE-2009-2446)\nNote: To exploit the CVE-2009-2446 flaws, the general query log (the mysqld\n\"--log\" command line option or the \"log\" option in \"/etc/my.cnf\") must be\nenabled. This logging is not enabled by default.\nThis update also fixes multiple bugs. Details regarding these bugs can be\nfound in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.4 Technical Notes. You can find a\nlink to the Technical Notes in the References section of this errata.\nNote: These updated packages upgrade MySQL to version 5.0.77 to incorporate\nnumerous upstream bug fixes. Details of these changes are found in the\nfollowing MySQL Release Notes:\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/news-5-0-77.html\nAll MySQL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\nresolve these issues. After installing this update, the MySQL server\ndaemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
