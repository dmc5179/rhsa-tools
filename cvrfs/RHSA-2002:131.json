These updates fix an input validation error in OpenSSH.","OpenSSH provides an implementation of the SSH (secure shell) protocol used\nfor logging into and executing commands on remote machines.  \nVersions of the OpenSSH server between 2.3.1 and 3.3 contain an input\nvalidation error that can result in an integer overflow and privilege\nescalation.\nAt this time, Red Hat does not believe that the default installation of\nOpenSSH on Red Hat Linux is vulnerable to this issue; however a user would\nbe vulnerable if the configuration option \"PAMAuthenticationViaKbdInt\" is\nenabled in the sshd configuration file (it is not enabled by default).\nWe have applied the security fix provided by the OpenSSH team to these\nerrata packages which are based on OpenSSH 3.1p1.  This should minimize the\nimpact of upgrading to our errata packages.\nAll users of OpenSSH should update to these errata packages which are not\nvulnerable to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
