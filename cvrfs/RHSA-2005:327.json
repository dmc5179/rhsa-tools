The telnet-server\npackage includes a telnet daemon, telnetd, that supports remote login to\nthe host machine.\nTwo buffer overflow flaws were discovered in the way the telnet client\nhandles messages from a server.  An attacker may be able to execute\narbitrary code on a victim's machine if the victim can be tricked into\nconnecting to a malicious telnet server. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CAN-2005-0468\nand CAN-2005-0469 to these issues.\nAdditionally, the following bugs have been fixed in these erratum packages\nfor Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3:\n- telnetd could loop on an error in the child side process\n- There was a race condition in telnetd on a wtmp lock on some occasions\n- The command line in the process table was sometimes too long and caused\nbad output from the ps command\n- The 8-bit binary option was not working\nUsers of telnet should upgrade to this updated package, which contains\nbackported patches to correct these issues.\nRed Hat would like to thank iDEFENSE for their responsible disclosure of\nthis issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
