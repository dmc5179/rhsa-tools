A user who has a revoked but otherwise valid certificate\ncould take advantage of this issue and bypass the revocation list, although\nin practice they would have no way of influencing which revoked certificate\nentries were missing or the time period.  (CVE-2007-4994)\nThe updated packages apply a bug fix for a 404 error caused by the server \nnot handling OCSP requests in the GET method.\nUsers of Red Hat Certificate System should upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain a patch to correct this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
