It is designed to\nprovide DNS and, optionally, DHCP, to a small network.\nThe dnsmasq DNS resolver used a fixed source UDP port. This could have made\nDNS spoofing attacks easier. dnsmasq has been updated to use random UDP\nsource ports, helping to make DNS spoofing attacks harder. (CVE-2008-1447)\nAll dnsmasq users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, that\nupgrades dnsmasq to version 2.45, which resolves this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
