This could allow a local,\nunprivileged user to execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service\n(kernel panic). (CVE-2007-5966, Important)\n* a flaw was found in the Intel PRO/1000 network driver in the Linux\nkernel. Frames with sizes near the MTU of an interface may be split across\nmultiple hardware receive descriptors. Receipt of such a frame could leak\nthrough a validation check, leading to a corruption of the length check. A\nremote attacker could use this flaw to send a specially-crafted packet that\nwould cause a denial of service or code execution. (CVE-2009-1385,\nImportant)\n* Michael Tokarev reported a flaw in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in\nthe Linux kernel. This driver allowed interfaces using this driver to\nreceive frames larger than could be handled, which could lead to a remote\ndenial of service or code execution. (CVE-2009-1389, Important)\n* the ADDR_COMPAT_LAYOUT and MMAP_PAGE_ZERO flags were not cleared when a\nsetuid or setgid program was executed. A local, unprivileged user could use\nthis flaw to bypass the mmap_min_addr protection mechanism and perform a\nNULL pointer dereference attack, or bypass the Address Space Layout\nRandomization (ASLR) security feature. (CVE-2009-1895, Important)\n* Ramon de Carvalho Valle reported two flaws in the Linux kernel eCryptfs\nimplementation. A local attacker with permissions to perform an eCryptfs\nmount could modify the metadata of the files in that eCrypfts mount to\ncause a buffer overflow, leading to a denial of service or privilege\nescalation. (CVE-2009-2406, CVE-2009-2407, Important)\n* Konstantin Khlebnikov discovered a race condition in the ptrace\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. This race condition can occur when the\nprocess tracing and the process being traced participate in a core dump. A\nlocal, unprivileged user could use this flaw to trigger a deadlock,\nresulting in a partial denial of service. (CVE-2009-1388, Moderate)\nBug fixes (see References below for a link to more detailed notes):\n* possible dom0 crash when a Xen para-virtualized guest was installed while\nanother para-virtualized guest was rebooting. (BZ#497812)\n* no directory removal audit record if the directory and its subtree were\nrecursively watched by an audit rule. (BZ#507561)\n* running \"echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\" under high memory load could\ncause a kernel panic. (BZ#503692)\n* on 32-bit systems, core dumps for some multithreaded applications did not\ninclude all thread information. (BZ#505322)\n* a stack buffer used by get_event_name() was too small for nul terminator\nsprintf() writes. This could lead to an invalid pointer or kernel panic.\n(BZ#506906)\n* when using the aic94xx driver, systems with SATA drives may not boot due\nto a libsas bug. (BZ#506029)\n* Wacom Cintiq 21UX and Intuos stylus buttons were handled incorrectly when\nmoved away from and back to these tablets. (BZ#508275)\n* CPU \"soft lockup\" messages and possibe system hangs on systems with\ncertain Broadcom network devices and running the Linux kernel from the\nkernel-xen package. (BZ#503689)\n* on 64-bit PowerPC, getitimer() failed for programs using the ITIMER_REAL\ntimer that were also compiled for 64-bit systems. This caused such programs\nto abort. (BZ#510018)\n* write operations could be blocked even when using O_NONBLOCK. (BZ#510239)\n* the \"pci=nomsi\" option was required for installing and booting Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 5.2 on systems with VIA VT3364 chipsets. (BZ#507529)\n* shutting down, destroying, or migrating Xen guests with large amounts of\nmemory could cause other guests to be temporarily unresponsive. (BZ#512311)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. Systems must be rebooted for this update\nto take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
