These packages are required for the Red Hat Security Advisory\nregarding applications linked against the old ucd-snmp libraries and also\nfix other security issues in ethereal.","Ethereal is a network traffic analyzer and monitor.\nThe Red Hat Security Advisory for ucd-snmp included updated libraries. All\napplications linked against the old ucd-snmp libraries need to be\nupdated.\nIf you have updated your ucd-snmp package you must update the ethereal\npackage as well.\nFor all other third party applications possibly affected by the Red Hat\nSecurity Advisory for ucd-snmp, please contact the software vendor.\nThis errata provides Ethereal version 0.9.6. Previous versions of Ethereal\nwere found to contain a number of security issues:\nBuffer overflow in Ethereal 0.9.5 and earlier allows remote attackers\nto cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code via the ISIS\ndissector. (CAN-2002-0834)\nBuffer overflows in Ethereal 0.9.4 and earlier allow remote attackers\nto cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code via the BGP\ndissector or the WCP dissector. (CAN-2002-0821)\nEthereal 0.9.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial\nof service and possibly excecute arbitrary code via the SOCKS, \nRSVP, AFS, or LMP dissectors, which can be caused to core\ndump. (CAN-2002-0822)\nDue to improper string and error handling in Ethereal's ASN.1 parser, it\nis possible for a malformed SNMP or LDAP packet to cause a memory\nallocation or buffer overrun error in Ethereal versions before 0.9.2.\n(CAN-2002-0013 CAN-2002-0012)\nThe ASN.1 parser in Ethereal 0.9.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to\ncause a denial of service (crash) via a certain malformed packet, which\ncauses Ethereal to allocate memory incorrectly, possibly due to zero-length\nfields. (CAN-2002-0353)\nThe SMB dissector in Ethereal prior to version 0.9.2 allows remote\nattackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code\nvia malformed packets that cause Ethereal to dereference a NULL pointer.\n(CAN-2002-0401)\nA buffer overflow in X11 dissector in Ethereal before 0.9.4 allows\nremote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly\nexecute arbitrary code while Ethereal is parsing keysyms. (CAN-2002-0402)\nThe DNS dissector in Ethereal before 0.9.4 allows remote attackers to\ncause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a malformed packet\nthat causes Ethereal to enter an infinite loop. (CAN-2002-0403)\nA vulnerability in the GIOP dissector in Ethereal before 0.9.4 allows\nremote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).\n(CAN-2002-0404)","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
