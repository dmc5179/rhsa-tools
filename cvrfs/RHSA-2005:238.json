Evolution includes a mailer, calendar, contact manager, and\ncommunication facility.  The tools which make up Evolution are tightly\nintegrated with one another and act as a seamless personal information\nmanagement tool.\nA bug was found in Evolution's helper program camel-lock-helper. This\nbug could allow a local attacker to gain root privileges if\ncamel-lock-helper has been built to execute with elevated privileges. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2005-0102 to this issue. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux,\ncamel-lock-helper is not built to execute with elevated privileges by\ndefault. Please note however that if users have rebuilt Evolution from the\nsource RPM, as the root user, camel-lock-helper may be given elevated\nprivileges.\nAdditionally, these updated packages address the following issues:\n-- If evolution ran during a GNOME session, the evolution-wombat process \ndid not exit when the user logged out of the desktop.\n-- For folders marked for Offline Synchronization: if a user moved a\nmessage from a Local Folder to an IMAP folder while in\nOffline mode, the message was not present in either folder after\nreturning to Online mode.\nThis update fixes this problem. Email messages that have been lost \nthis way may still be present in the following path: \n~/evolution/&lt;NAME_OF_MAIL_STORE&gt;/ \\\n&lt;path-to-folder-via-subfolder-directories&gt;/ \\\n&lt;temporary-uid-of-message&gt;\nIf this bug has affected you it may be possible to recover data by\nexamining the contents of this directory.\nAll users of evolution should upgrade to these updated packages, which\nresolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
