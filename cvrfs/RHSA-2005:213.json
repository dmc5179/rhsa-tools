An attacker could\nconstruct a carefully crafted PDF file that could cause Xpdf to crash or\npossibly execute arbitrary code when opened. This issue was assigned the\nname CAN-2004-0888 by The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org). RHSA-2004:592 contained a fix for this issue, but it was\nfound to be incomplete and left 64-bit architectures vulnerable. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2005-0206 to this issue.\nAll users of xpdf should upgrade to this updated package, which contains\nbackported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
