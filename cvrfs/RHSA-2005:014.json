A misconfigured or malicious peer could cause statd to crash,\nleading to a denial of service.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1014 to this issue.\nArjan van de Ven discovered a buffer overflow in rquotad.  On 64-bit\narchitectures, an improper integer conversion can lead to a buffer\noverflow.  An attacker with access to an NFS share could send a specially\ncrafted request which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2004-0946 to this issue.\nAll users of nfs-utils should upgrade to this updated package, which\nresolves these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
