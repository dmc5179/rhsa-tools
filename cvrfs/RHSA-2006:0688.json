If\na script can cause memory allocation based on untrusted user data, a remote\nattacker sending a carefully crafted request could execute arbitrary code\nas the 'apache' user.  (CVE-2006-4812)\nA buffer overflow was discovered in the PHP sscanf() function.  If a script\nused the sscanf() function with positional arguments in the format string,\na remote attacker sending a carefully crafted request could execute\narbitrary code as the 'apache' user.  (CVE-2006-4020)\nAn integer overflow was discovered in the PHP wordwrap() and str_repeat()\nfunctions.  If a script running on a 64-bit server used either of these\nfunctions on untrusted user data, a remote attacker sending a carefully\ncrafted request might be able to cause a heap overflow.  (CVE-2006-4482)\nA buffer overflow was discovered in the PHP gd extension. If a script was\nset up to process GIF images from untrusted sources using the gd extension,\na remote attacker could cause a heap overflow. (CVE-2006-4484)\nA buffer overread was discovered in the PHP stripos() function.  If a\nscript used the stripos() function with untrusted user data, PHP may read\npast the end of a buffer, which could allow a denial of service attack by a\nremote user. (CVE-2006-4485)\nAn integer overflow was discovered in the PHP memory allocation handling. \nOn 64-bit platforms, the \"memory_limit\" setting was not enforced correctly,\nwhich could allow a denial of service attack by a remote user. (CVE-2006-4486)\nThese packages also contain a fix for a bug where certain input strings to\nthe metaphone() function could cause memory corruption.\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
