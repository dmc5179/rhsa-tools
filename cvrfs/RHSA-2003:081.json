There are no known exploits\nof the gzprintf overrun, and only a few programs, including rpm2html\nand gimp-print, are known to use the gzprintf function.\nThe problem has been fixed by checking the length of the output string\nwithin gzprintf.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
