An\nattacker could create a malicious TIFF file that could, potentially,\nexecute arbitrary code as the \"lp\" user if the file was printed.\n(CVE-2009-0163)\nRed Hat would like to thank Aaron Sigel of the Apple Product Security team\nfor responsibly reporting this flaw.\nUsers of cups are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the\nupdate, the cupsd daemon will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
