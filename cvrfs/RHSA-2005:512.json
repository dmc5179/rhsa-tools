These bugs\ncould cause Midnight Commander to hang or crash if a victim opens a\ncarefully crafted file. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CAN-2004-1009, CAN-2004-1090,\nCAN-2004-1091, CAN-2004-1093 and CAN-2004-1174 to these issues.\nA filename quoting bug was found in Midnight Commander's FISH protocol\nhandler. If a victim connects via embedded SSH support to a host containing\na carefully crafted filename, arbitrary code may be executed as the user\nrunning Midnight Commander. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1175 to this issue.\nA buffer overflow bug was found in the way Midnight Commander handles\ndirectory completion. If a victim uses completion on a maliciously crafted\ndirectory path, it is possible for arbitrary code to be executed as the\nuser running Midnight Commander. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0763 to this issue.\nUsers of mc are advised to upgrade to these packages, which contain\nbackported security patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
