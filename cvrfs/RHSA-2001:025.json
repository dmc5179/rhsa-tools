Updated pam_krb5 packages are now available for Red Hat Linux 7.","A race condition exists in libkrb4 which would allow a malicious user to\ncause kerberized login services to overwrite the contents of any file on\nthe system.  The destroyed file would contain the kerberos credentials of\nan unsuspecting user who had attempted to log in using the kerberized login\nservice being exploited.\nAdditional precautions taken in Kerberos 5 1.2.2 will cause pam_krb5 to\nfail when it attempts to create Kerberos IV ticket files on behalf of\nusers.  An update for the pam_krb5 package is also available which corrects\nthis.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
