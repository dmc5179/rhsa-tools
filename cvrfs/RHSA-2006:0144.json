This is the seventh\nregular update.\nThis security advisory has been rated as having moderate security impact\nby the Red Hat Security Response Team.","The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.\nThis is the seventh regular kernel update to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.\nNew features introduced by this update include:\n- addition of the bnx2, dell_rbu, and megaraid_sas device drivers\n- support for multi-core, multi-threaded Intel Itanium processors\n- upgrade of the SATA subsystem to include ATAPI and SMART support\n- optional tuning via the new numa_memory_allocator, arp_announce,\nand printk_ratelimit sysctls\nThere were many bug fixes in various parts of the kernel.  The ongoing\neffort to resolve these problems has resulted in a marked improvement in\nthe reliability and scalability of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.\nThere were numerous driver updates and security fixes (elaborated below).\nOther key areas affected by fixes in this update include the networking\nsubsystem, the VM subsystem, NPTL handling, autofs4, the USB subsystem,\nCPU enumeration, and 32-bit-exec-mode handling on 64-bit architectures.\nThe following device drivers have been upgraded to new versions:\naacraid -------- 1.1.5-2412\nbnx2 ----------- 1.4.30 (new)\ndell_rbu ------- 2.1 (new)\ne1000 ---------- 6.1.16-k3\nemulex --------- 7.3.3\nfusion --------- 2.06.16.02\nipmi ----------- 35.11\nmegaraid2 ------ v2.10.10.1\nmegaraid_sas --- 00.00.02.00 (new)\ntg3 ------------ 3.43RH\nThe following security bugs were fixed in this update:\n- a flaw in gzip/zlib handling internal to the kernel that allowed\na local user to cause a denial of service (crash)\n(CVE-2005-2458,low)\n- a flaw in ext3 EA/ACL handling of attribute sharing that allowed\na local user to gain privileges (CVE-2005-2801, moderate)\n- a minor info leak with the get_thread_area() syscall that allowed\na local user to view uninitialized kernel stack data\n(CVE-2005-3276, low)\nNote: The kernel-unsupported package contains various drivers and modules\nthat are unsupported and therefore might contain security problems that\nhave not been addressed.\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 users are advised to upgrade their\nkernels to the packages associated with their machine architectures\nand configurations as listed in this erratum.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
