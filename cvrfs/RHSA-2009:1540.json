A local, unprivileged user could use\nthis flaw to bypass the mmap_min_addr protection mechanism and perform a\nNULL pointer dereference attack, or bypass the Address Space Layout\nRandomization (ASLR) security feature. (CVE-2009-1895, Important)\n* a system with SELinux enforced was more permissive in allowing local\nusers in the unconfined_t domain to map low memory areas even if the\nmmap_min_addr restriction was enabled. This could aid in the local\nexploitation of NULL pointer dereference bugs. (CVE-2009-2695, Important)\n* missing initialization flaws were found in getname() implementations in\nnumerous network protocol implementations in the Linux kernel. Certain\ndata structures in these getname() implementations were not initialized\nproperly before being copied to user-space. These flaws could lead to an\ninformation leak. (CVE-2009-3002, Important)\n* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in each of the following\nfunctions in the Linux kernel: pipe_read_open(), pipe_write_open(), and\npipe_rdwr_open(). When the mutex lock is not held, the i_pipe pointer could\nbe released by other processes before it is used to update the pipe's\nreader and writer counters. This could lead to a local denial of service or\nprivilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3547, Important)\n* a flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux\nkernel. pci_unmap_single() presented a memory leak that could lead to IOMMU\nspace exhaustion and a system crash. An attacker on the local network could\nabuse this flaw by using jumbo frames for large amounts of network traffic.\n(CVE-2009-3613, Important)\n* NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in the r128 driver in the\nLinux kernel. Checks to test if the Concurrent Command Engine state was\ninitialized were missing in private IOCTL functions. An attacker could use\nthese flaws to cause a local denial of service or escalate their\nprivileges. (CVE-2009-3620, Important)\n* Kees Cook and Steve Beattie discovered a race condition in the /proc\ncode in the Linux kernel. This could lead to information in the\n\"/proc/[pid]/maps\" and \"/proc/[pid]/smaps\" files being leaked to users (who\nwould otherwise not have access to this information) during ELF loading.\nThis could help a local attacker bypass the ASLR security feature.\n(CVE-2009-2691, Moderate)\n* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the md driver in the Linux\nkernel. If the suspend_lo or suspend_hi file in \"/sys/\" is modified when\nthe disk array is inactive, it could lead to a local denial of service or\nprivilege escalation. By default, only root can write to these two files.\n(CVE-2009-2849, Moderate)\n* an information leak was found in the Linux kernel. On AMD64 systems,\n32-bit processes could access and read certain 64-bit registers by\ntemporarily switching themselves to 64-bit mode. (CVE-2009-2910, Moderate)\n* padding data in several core network structures was not initialized\nproperly before being sent to user-space, possibly leading to information\nleaks. (CVE-2009-3228, CVE-2009-3612, Moderate)\n* the unix_stream_connect() function in the Linux kernel did not check if a\nUNIX domain socket was in the shutdown state. This could lead to a\ndeadlock. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial\nof service. (CVE-2009-3621, Moderate)\nThese updated packages also include bug fixes and enhancements. Users are\ndirected to the Realtime Security Update Release Notes for version 1.1 for\ninformation on these changes, which will be available shortly from: \nhttp://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_MRG/\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues and add enhancements.
