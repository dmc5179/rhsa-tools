This could, potentially, cause the network\nconnectivity to cease. (CVE-2009-0778, Important)\n* Chris Evans reported a deficiency in the clone() system call when called\nwith the CLONE_PARENT flag. This flaw permits the caller (the parent\nprocess) to indicate an arbitrary signal it wants to receive when its child\nprocess exits. This could lead to a denial of service of the parent\nprocess. (CVE-2009-0028, Moderate)\n* an off-by-one underflow flaw was found in the eCryptfs subsystem. This\ncould potentially cause a local denial of service when the readlink()\nfunction returned an error. (CVE-2009-0269, Moderate)\n* a deficiency was found in the Remote BIOS Update (RBU) driver for Dell\nsystems. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to cause a denial of\nservice by reading zero bytes from the image_type or packet_size files in\n\"/sys/devices/platform/dell_rbu/\". (CVE-2009-0322, Moderate)\n* an inverted logic flaw was found in the SysKonnect FDDI PCI adapter\ndriver, allowing driver statistics to be reset only when the CAP_NET_ADMIN\ncapability was absent (local, unprivileged users could reset driver\nstatistics). (CVE-2009-0675, Moderate)\n* the sock_getsockopt() function in the Linux kernel did not properly\ninitialize a data structure that can be directly returned to user-space\nwhen the getsockopt() function is called with SO_BSDCOMPAT optname set.\nThis flaw could possibly lead to memory disclosure.\n(CVE-2009-0676, Moderate)\n* the ext2 and ext3 file system code failed to properly handle corrupted\ndata structures, leading to a possible local denial of service when read\nor write operations were performed on a specially-crafted file system.\n(CVE-2008-3528, Low)\n* a deficiency was found in the libATA implementation. This could,\npotentially, lead to a local denial of service. Note: by default, the\n\"/dev/sg*\" devices are accessible only to the root user.\n(CVE-2008-5700, Low)\nBug fixes:\n* a bug in aic94xx may have caused kernel panics during boot on some\nsystems with certain SATA disks. (BZ#485909)\n* a word endianness problem in the qla2xx driver on PowerPC-based machines\nmay have corrupted flash-based devices. (BZ#485908)\n* a memory leak in pipe() may have caused a system deadlock. The workaround\nin Section 1.5, Known Issues, of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3 Release\nNotes Updates, which involved manually allocating extra file descriptors to\nprocesses calling do_pipe, is no longer necessary. (BZ#481576)\n* CPU soft-lockups in the network rate estimator. (BZ#481746)\n* bugs in the ixgbe driver caused it to function unreliably on some\nsystems with 16 or more CPU cores. (BZ#483210)\n* the iwl4965 driver may have caused a kernel panic. (BZ#483206)\n* a bug caused NFS attributes to not update for some long-lived NFS\nmounted file systems. (BZ#483201)\n* unmounting a GFS2 file system may have caused a panic. (BZ#485910)\n* a bug in ptrace() may have caused a panic when single stepping a target.\n(BZ#487394)\n* on some 64-bit systems, notsc was incorrectly set at boot, causing slow\ngettimeofday() calls. (BZ#488239)\n* do_machine_check() cleared all Machine Check Exception (MCE) status\nregisters, preventing the BIOS from using them to determine the cause of\ncertain panics and errors. (BZ#490433)\n* scaling problems caused performance problems for LAPI applications.\n(BZ#489457)\n* a panic may have occurred on systems using certain Intel WiFi Link 5000\nproducts when booting with the RF Kill switch on. (BZ#489846)\n* the TSC is invariant with C/P/T states, and always runs at constant\nfrequency from now on. (BZ#489310)\nAll users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for\nthis update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
