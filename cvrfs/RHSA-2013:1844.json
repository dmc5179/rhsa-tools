A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\nbase score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the\nCVE link in the References section.","Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit combines popular open source web frameworks\ninto a single solution for Java applications. The Apache Solr component is\nan open-source search server based on the Lucene Java search library.\nIt was found that the SolrResourceLoader class in Apache Solr allowed\nloading of resources via absolute paths, or relative paths which were not\nsanitized for directory traversal. Some Solr components expose REST\ninterfaces which load resources (XSL style sheets and Velocity templates)\nvia SolrResourceLoader, using paths identified by REST parameters. A remote\nattacker could use this flaw to load arbitrary local files on the server\nvia SolrResourceLoader, potentially resulting in information disclosure or\nremote code execution. (CVE-2013-6397)\nIt was found that the XML and XSLT UpdateRequestHandler classes in Apache\nSolr would resolve external entities, allowing an attacker to conduct XML\nExternal Entity (XXE) attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to\nread files accessible to the user running the application server, and\npotentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2012-6612,\nCVE-2013-6407)\nIt was found that the DocumentAnalysisRequestHandler class in Apache Solr\nwould resolve external entities, allowing an attacker to conduct XXE\nattacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to read files accessible to\nthe user running the application server, and potentially perform other more\nadvanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2013-6408)\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.4.0 as provided from the Red\nHat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
