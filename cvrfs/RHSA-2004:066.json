applying this update, make sure all previously released errata\nrelevant to your system have been applied.\nTo update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:\nrpm -Fvh [filenames]\nwhere

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of\nup2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be\ndownloaded directly from the RHN website:\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2004:066"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Important","type":"Impact"}},"acknowledgments":{"acknowledgment":{"description":"Red Hat would like to thank Paul Starzetz (ISEC) for reporting this issue."}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated kernel packages that fix a security vulnerability that may allow\nlocal users to gain root privileges are now available.
