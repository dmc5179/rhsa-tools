A man-in-the-middle\nattacker could use this flaw to prefix arbitrary plain text to a client's\nsession (for example, an HTTPS connection to a website). This could force\nthe server to process an attacker's request as if authenticated using the\nvictim's credentials. This update partially mitigates this flaw for SSL\nsessions to HTTP servers using mod_ssl by rejecting client-requested\nrenegotiation. (CVE-2009-3555)\nNote: This update does not fully resolve the issue for HTTPS servers. An\nattack is still possible in configurations that require a server-initiated\nrenegotiation. Refer to the following Knowledgebase article for further\ninformation: http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-20491\nA denial of service flaw was found in the Apache mod_deflate module. This\nmodule continued to compress large files until compression was complete,\neven if the network connection that requested the content was closed before\ncompression completed. This would cause mod_deflate to consume large\namounts of CPU if mod_deflate was enabled for a large file. (CVE-2009-1891)\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Apache mod_proxy_ftp\nmodule. A malicious FTP server to which requests are being proxied could\nuse this flaw to crash an httpd child process via a malformed reply to the\nEPSV or PASV commands, resulting in a limited denial of service.\n(CVE-2009-3094)\nA second flaw was found in the Apache mod_proxy_ftp module. In a reverse\nproxy configuration, a remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass\nintended access restrictions by creating a carefully-crafted HTTP\nAuthorization header, allowing the attacker to send arbitrary commands to\nthe FTP server. (CVE-2009-3095)\nAll httpd users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues. After installing the updated\npackages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
