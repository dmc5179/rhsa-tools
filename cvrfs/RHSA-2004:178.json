An attacker could exploit the buffer overflows by\ncreating a carefully crafted LHA archive in such a way that arbitrary code\nwould be executed when the archive is tested or extracted by a victim.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-0234 to this issue.  An attacker could exploit\nthe directory traversal issues to create files as the victim outside of the\nexpected directory.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0235 to this issue.\nUsers of LHA should update to this updated package which contains\nbackported patches not vulnerable to these issues.\nRed Hat would like to thank Ulf Harnhammar for disclosing and providing\ntest cases and patches for these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
