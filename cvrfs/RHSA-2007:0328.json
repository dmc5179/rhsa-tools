This could allow attackers to poison a web-cache, bypass web\napplication firewall protection, or conduct cross-site scripting attacks. \n(CVE-2005-2090)\nTomcat permitted various characters as path delimiters. If Tomcat was used\nbehind certain proxies and configured to only proxy some contexts, an\nattacker could construct an HTTP request to work around the context\nrestriction and potentially access non-proxied content. (CVE-2007-0450)\nThe implict-objects.jsp file distributed in the examples webapp displayed a\nnumber of unfiltered header values. If the JSP examples are accessible,\nthis flaw could allow a remote attacker to perform cross-site scripting\nattacks. (CVE-2006-7195)\nUpdated jakarta-commons-modeler packages which correct a bug when\nused with Tomcat 5.5.23 are also included.\nUsers should upgrade to these erratum packages which contain an update to\nTomcat that resolves these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
