A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,\nwhich gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in\nthe References section.","The GNOME Display Manager (GDM) is a configurable re-implementation of XDM,\nthe X Display Manager. GDM allows you to log in to your system with the X\nWindow System running, and supports running several different X sessions on\nyour local machine at the same time.\nA flaw was found in the way the gdm package was built. The gdm package was\nmissing TCP wrappers support on 64-bit platforms, which could result in an\nadministrator believing they had access restrictions enabled when they did\nnot. (CVE-2007-5079)\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n* sometimes the system would hang instead of properly shutting down when\na user chose \"Shut down\" from the login screen. (BZ#625818)\nAll users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains backported\npatches to correct these issues. GDM must be restarted for this update to\ntake effect. Rebooting achieves this, but changing the runlevel from 5 to 3\nand back to 5 also restarts GDM.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
