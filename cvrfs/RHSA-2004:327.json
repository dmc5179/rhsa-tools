These consist of invalid conversions of 64 to 32-bit file\noffset pointers and possible race conditions. A local unprivileged user\ncould make use of these flaws to access large portions of kernel memory.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-0415 to this issue.\nA flaw was discovered in an error path supporting the clone() system call\nthat allowed local users to cause a denial of service (memory leak) by\npassing invalid arguments to clone() running in an infinite loop of a\nuser's program (CAN-2004-0427).\nEnhancements were committed to the 2.6 kernel by Al Viro which enabled the\nSparse source code checking tool to check for a certain class of kernel\nbugs. A subset of these fixes also applies to various drivers in the 2.4\nkernel. Although the majority of these resides in drivers unsupported in\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 3, the flaws could lead to privilege escalation or\naccess to kernel memory (CAN-2004-0495).\nDuring an audit of the Linux kernel, SUSE discovered a flaw that allowed\na user to make unauthorized changes to the group ID of files in certain\ncircumstances. In the 2.4 kernel, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux, the only way this could happen is through the kernel NFS server. A\nuser on a system that mounted a remote file system from a vulnerable\nmachine may be able to make unauthorized changes to the group ID of\nexported files (CAN-2004-0497).\nA bug in the e1000 network driver has been addressed. This bug could be\nused by local users to leak small amounts of kernel memory (CAN-2004-0535).\nInappropriate permissions on /proc/scsi/qla2300/HbaApiNode (CAN-2004-0587).\nThe following drivers have also been updated:\nfusion to 2.05.16\nips to 7.00.15\ncciss to 2.4.52\ne1000 to v. 5.2.52-k1\ne100 to v. 2.3.43-k1\nAll users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which contain\nbackported security patches that correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
