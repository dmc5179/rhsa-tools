A failure during this\nprocedure may compromise the readability of all or part of your Kerberos\nkeys.\n1. Upgrade all of your servers (masters and replicas) and restart the\ndirsrv service on all of them. No other daemon needs to be restarted at\nthis stage.\n2. On one master server, run the following tool:\n$ ipa-fix-2008-3274 --check\nThis should report that the system is vulnerable.\n3. On the same master server, run the following tool:\n$ ipa-fix-2008-3274 --fix\nThis should dump all Kerberos principals, reload them, and then return a \nmessage stating that the operation completed successfully. If not, you\nshould contact Red Hat GSS for immediate assistance.\nThis step should also create a .gpg file symmetrically-encrypted with the \nDirectory Manager password. This file contains a backup of all Kerberos \nkey material and is written to /var/lib/ipa/.\nAttention: DO NOT RUN THIS COMMAND ON ANY OTHER SERVER. See the next step.\n4. On all other IPA servers, run the following tool:\n$ ipa-fix-2008-3274 --fix-replica\nThis will report that the system is NOT vulnerable and will then download\nthe master key for the local KDC instance. This command will restart the\nKDC service.\nIf the command reports a system as anything other than not vulnerable,\nverify that replication between masters is working correctly. The procedure\nwill not successfully complete until replication failures are addressed.\nBefore applying this update, make sure that all previously-released\nerrata relevant to your system have been applied.\nThis update is available via Red Hat Network.  Details on how to use\nthe Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at\nhttp://kbase.redhat.com/faq/FAQ_58_10188","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008:0860"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Important","type":"Impact"}},"discovery_date":"2008-08-04T00:00:00Z","ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated ipa packages that fix a security flaw are now available for Red Hat\nEnterprise IPA.\nThis update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.","Red Hat Enterprise IPA is an integrated solution to provide\ncentrally-managed Identity (machines, users, virtual machines, groups,\nauthentication credentials), Policy (configuration settings, access control\ninformation) and Audit (events, logs, analysis) services.\nA flaw was found in the Red Hat Enterprise IPA installation procedure. The\nmaster Kerberos password was set up in the LDAP server in such a way that\nit was possible to retrieve the password via an anonymous LDAP connection.\n(CVE-2008-3274)\nNote: the master Kerberos password is used to encrypt keys.
