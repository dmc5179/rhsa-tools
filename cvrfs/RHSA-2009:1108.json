The httpd package shipped\nwith Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 contains an embedded copy of the Apache\nPortable Runtime (APR) utility library, a free library of C data structures\nand routines, which includes interfaces to support XML parsing, LDAP\nconnections, database interfaces, URI parsing, and more.\nAn off-by-one overflow flaw was found in the way apr-util processed a\nvariable list of arguments. An attacker could provide a specially-crafted\nstring as input for the formatted output conversion routine, which could,\non big-endian platforms, potentially lead to the disclosure of sensitive\ninformation or a denial of service (application crash). (CVE-2009-1956)\nNote: The CVE-2009-1956 flaw only affects big-endian platforms, such as the\nIBM S/390 and PowerPC. It does not affect users using the httpd package on\nlittle-endian platforms, due to their different organization of byte\nordering used to represent particular data.\nA denial of service flaw was found in the apr-util Extensible Markup\nLanguage (XML) parser. A remote attacker could create a specially-crafted\nXML document that would cause excessive memory consumption when processed\nby the XML decoding engine. (CVE-2009-1955)\nA heap-based underwrite flaw was found in the way apr-util created compiled\nforms of particular search patterns. An attacker could formulate a\nspecially-crafted search keyword, that would overwrite arbitrary heap\nmemory locations when processed by the pattern preparation engine.\n(CVE-2009-0023)\nAll httpd users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues. After installing the updated\npackages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
