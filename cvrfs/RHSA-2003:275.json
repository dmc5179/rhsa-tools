Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate \nErrors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated \ncertificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat \nFTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003:275"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Moderate","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated CUPS packages that fix a problem where CUPS can hang are now available.","CUPS is a print spooler.\nPaul Mitcheson reported a situation where the CUPS Internet Printing\nProtocol (IPP) implementation in CUPS versions prior to 1.1.19 would get\ninto a busy loop.  This could result in a denial of service.  In order to\nexploit this bug an attacker would need to have the ability to make a TCP\nconnection to the IPP port (by default 631). \nUsers of CUPS are advised to install these updated packages, which contain\na backported security patch and are not vulnerable to this issue.\nThese packages also fix a problem with the LPD backend that could cause\njobs to be repeated.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
