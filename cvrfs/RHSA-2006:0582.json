These core packages include the file manager Konqueror.\nIlja van Sprundel discovered a lock file handling flaw in kcheckpass.  If\nthe directory /var/lock is writable by a user who is allowed to run\nkcheckpass, that user could gain root privileges.  In Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux, the /var/lock directory is not writable by users and therefore this\nflaw could only have been exploited if the permissions on that directory\nhave been badly configured.  A patch to block this issue has been included\nin this update.  (CVE-2005-2494)\nThe following bugs have also been addressed:\n- kstart --tosystray does not send the window to the system tray in Kicker\n- When the customer enters or selects URLs in Firefox's address field, the\ndesktop freezes for a couple of seconds\n- fish kioslave is broken on 64-bit systems\nAll users of kdebase should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
