During an audit of the CVS sources, Stefan Esser\ndiscovered an exploitable double-free bug in the CVS server.\nOn servers which are configured to allow anonymous read-only access, this\nbug could be used by anonymous users to gain write privileges.  Users with\nCVS write privileges can then use the Update-prog and Checkin-prog features\nto execute arbitrary commands on the server.\nAll users of CVS are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages which\ncontain patches to correct the double-free bug.\nOur thanks go to Stefan Esser of e-matters for reporting this issue to us.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
