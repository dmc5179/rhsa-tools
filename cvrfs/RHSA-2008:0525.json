This\nupdate includes fixes for a number of security issues in Red Hat Network\nSatellite Server Solaris client components.\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.","This release corrects several security vulnerabilities in various\ncomponents shipped as part of the Red Hat Network Satellite Server Solaris\nclient. In a typical operating environment, these components are not used\nby the Satellite Server in a vulnerable manner. These security updates will\nreduce risk should these components be used by other applications.\nSeveral flaws in Zlib was discovered. An attacker could create a\ncarefully-crafted compressed stream that would cause an application to\ncrash if the stream is opened by a user. (CVE-2005-2096).  An attacker\ncould create a carefully crafted compressed stream that would cause an\napplication to crash if the stream is opened by a user. (CVE-2005-1849)\nA buffer overflow was discovered in the OpenSSL SSL_get_shared_ciphers()\nutility function. An attacker could send a list of ciphers to an\napplication that used this function and overrun a buffer (CVE-2006-3738).\nA flaw in the SSLv2 client code was discovered. If a client application\nused OpenSSL to create an SSLv2 connection to a malicious server, that\nserver could cause the client to crash. (CVE-2006-4343)\nAn attack on OpenSSL PKCS #1 v1.5 signatures was discovered. Where an RSA\nkey with exponent 3 is used it may be possible for an attacker to forge a\nPKCS #1 v1.5 signature that would be incorrectly verified by\nimplementations that do not check for excess data in the RSA exponentiation\nresult of the signature. This issue affected applications that use OpenSSL\nto verify X.509 certificates as well as other uses of PKCS #1 v1.5.\n(CVE-2006-4339)\nOpenSSL contained a software work-around for a bug in SSL handling in\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer version 3.0.2. It is enabled in most servers\nthat use OpenSSL to provide support for SSL and TLS. This work-around could\nallow an attacker, acting as a \"man in the middle\" to force an SSL\nconnection to use SSL 2.0 rather than a stronger protocol, such as SSL 3.0\nor TLS 1.0. (CVE-2005-2969)\nDuring OpenSSL parsing of certain invalid ASN.1 structures an error\ncondition was mishandled. This can result in an infinite loop which\nconsumed system memory (CVE-2006-2937). \nCertain public key types can take disproportionate amounts of time to\nprocess in OpenSSL, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2006-2940)\nA flaw was discovered in the way that the Python repr() function handled\nUTF-32/UCS-4 strings. If an application written in Python used the repr()\nfunction on untrusted data, this could lead to a denial of service or\npossibly allow the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nPython application. (CVE-2006-4980)\nA flaw was discovered in the strxfrm() function of Python's locale module.\nStrings generated by this function were not properly NULL-terminated. This\nmay possibly cause disclosure of data stored in the memory of a Python\napplication using this function. (CVE-2007-2052)\nMultiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in Python's imageop module.\nIf an application written in Python used the imageop module to process\nuntrusted images, it could cause the application to crash, enter an\ninfinite loop, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of\nthe Python interpreter. (CVE-2007-4965)\nA stack-based buffer overflow was discovered in the Python interpreter,\nwhich could allow a local user to gain privileges by running a script with\na long name from the current working directory. (CVE-2006-1542)\nUsers of Red Hat Network Satellite Server should upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
