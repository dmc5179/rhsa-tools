(CVE-2006-6077, CVE-2007-0995,\nCVE-2007-0996)\nA flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey cached web pages on the local disk. A\nmalicious web page may be able to inject arbitrary HTML into a browsing\nsession if the user reloads a targeted site. (CVE-2007-0778)\nA flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey displayed certain web content. A\nmalicious web page could generate content which could overlay user\ninterface elements such as the hostname and security indicators, tricking a\nuser into thinking they are visiting a different site. (CVE-2007-0779)\nTwo flaws were found in the way SeaMonkey displayed blocked popup windows.\nIf a user can be convinced to open a blocked popup, it is possible to read\narbitrary local files, or conduct an XSS attack against the user.\n(CVE-2007-0780, CVE-2007-0800)\nTwo buffer overflow flaws were found in the Network Security Services (NSS)\ncode for processing the SSLv2 protocol. Connecting to a malicious secure\nweb server could cause the execution of arbitrary code as the user running\nSeaMonkey. (CVE-2007-0008, CVE-2007-0009)\nA flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled the \"location.hostname\" value\nduring certain browser domain checks. This flaw could allow a malicious web\nsite to set domain cookies for an arbitrary site, or possibly perform an\nXSS attack. (CVE-2007-0981)\nUsers of SeaMonkey are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain SeaMonkey version 1.0.8 that corrects these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
