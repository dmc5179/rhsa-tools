Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.","Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer\nPages (JSP) technologies.\nA flaw was found in the way Tomcat handled the Transfer-Encoding header in\nHTTP requests. A specially-crafted HTTP request could prevent Tomcat from\nsending replies, or cause Tomcat to return truncated replies, or replies\ncontaining data related to the requests of other users, for all subsequent\nHTTP requests. (CVE-2010-2227)\nThis erratum fixes two additional security flaws in Tomcat. In a typical\noperating environment, Tomcat is not exposed to users of Red Hat\nCertificate System in a vulnerable manner. These fixes will reduce risk in\nunique Certificate System environments. (CVE-2009-2693, CVE-2009-2902)\nUsers of Red Hat Certificate System 7.3 should upgrade to these updated\ntomcat5 packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.\nAfter installing the updated packages, the Red Hat Certificate System CA\n(rhpki-ca), DRM (rhpki-kra), OCSP (rhpki-ocsp), and TKS (rhpki-tks)\nsubsystems must be restarted (\"/etc/init.d/[instance-name] restart\") for\nthis update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
