(BZ#1713187, BZ#1713188)\nSecurity Fix(es):\n* nss: NULL pointer dereference in several CMS functions resulting in a denial of service (CVE-2018-18508)\n* nss: Out-of-bounds read when importing curve25519 private key (CVE-2019-11719)\n* nss: Empty or malformed p256-ECDH public keys may trigger a segmentation fault (CVE-2019-11729)\n* nss: PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures can be used for TLS 1.3 (CVE-2019-11727)\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\nBug Fix(es):\n* PQG verify fails when create DSA PQG parameters because the counts aren't returned correctly.
