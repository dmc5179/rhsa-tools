The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name CAN-2005-1263\nto this issue.\nA flaw in shared memory locking allowed local unprivileged users to lock\nand unlock regions of shared memory segments they did not own (CAN-2005-0176).\nA flaw in the locking of SysV IPC shared memory regions allowed local\nunprivileged users to bypass their RLIMIT_MEMLOCK resource limit\n(CAN-2004-0491).\nNote: The kernel-unsupported package contains various drivers and modules\nthat are unsupported and therefore might contain security problems that\nhave not been addressed.\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 users are advised to upgrade their\nkernels to the packages associated with their machine architectures\nand configurations as listed in this erratum.\nPlease also consult the RHEL3 Update 5 advisory RHSA-2005:294 for the\ncomplete list of features added and bugs fixed in U5, which was released\nonly a week prior to this security update.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
