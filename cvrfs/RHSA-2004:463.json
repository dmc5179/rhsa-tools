This issue is not believed to\nallow arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  This issue\nalso does not represent a significant denial of service attack as requests\nwill continue to be handled by other Apache child processes.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0786 to this issue.\nThe Swedish IT Incident Centre (SITIC) reported a buffer overflow in the\nexpansion of environment variables during configuration file parsing.  This\nissue could allow a local user to gain 'apache' privileges if an httpd\nprocess can be forced to parse a carefully crafted .htaccess file written\nby a local user.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0747 to this issue.\nAn issue was discovered in the mod_ssl module which could be triggered if\nthe server is configured to allow proxying to a remote SSL server.  A\nmalicious remote SSL server could force an httpd child process to crash by\nsending a carefully crafted response header.  This issue is not believed to\nallow execution of arbitrary code.  This issue also does not represent a\nsignificant Denial of Service attack as requests will continue to be\nhandled by other Apache child processes.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0751 to\nthis issue.\nAn issue was discovered in the mod_dav module which could be triggered for\na location where WebDAV authoring access has been configured.  A malicious\nremote client which is authorized to use the LOCK method could force an\nhttpd child process to crash by sending a particular sequence of LOCK\nrequests.  This issue does not allow execution of arbitrary code.  This\nissue also does not represent a significant Denial of Service attack as\nrequests will continue to be handled by other Apache child processes.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2004-0809 to this issue. \nUsers of the Apache HTTP server should upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain backported patches that address these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
