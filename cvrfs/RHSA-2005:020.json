An authenticated remote user could exploit this\nbug, which could lead to arbitrary code execution on the Samba server.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2004-1154 to this issue.\nPlease note that the patch included in RHSA-2004:681 was incomplete and may\nnot have fixed CAN-2004-1154.  These packages contain a complete fix for\nCAN-2004-1154 along with some additional checks to mitigate similar issues\nin the future.\nUsers of Samba should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported security patches, and are not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
