An\nattacker could use this to perform cross-site scripting attacks against\nsites that have publicly-available PHP scripts that call phpinfo(). \n(CVE-2006-0996)\nThe html_entity_decode() PHP function was found to not be binary safe. An\nattacker could use this flaw to disclose a certain part of the memory.  In\norder for this issue to be exploitable the target site would need to have a\nPHP script which called the \"html_entity_decode()\" function with untrusted\ninput from the user and displayed the result.  (CVE-2006-1490)\nThe error handling output was found to not properly escape HTML output in\ncertain cases.  An attacker could use this flaw to perform cross-site\nscripting attacks against sites where both display_errors and html_errors\nare enabled.  (CVE-2006-0208)\nAn input validation error was found in the \"mb_send_mail()\" function.  An\nattacker could use this flaw to inject arbitrary headers in a mail sent via\na script calling the \"mb_send_mail()\" function where the \"To\" parameter can\nbe controlled by the attacker.  (CVE-2005-3883)\nA buffer overflow flaw was discovered in uw-imap, the University of\nWashington's IMAP Server.  php-imap is compiled against the static c-client\nlibraries from imap and therefore needed to be recompiled against the fixed\nversion.  This issue only affected Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.\n(CVE-2005-2933).\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches that resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
