Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.","The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\nSecurity fixes:\n* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel NFSv4\nimplementation. Several of the NFSv4 file locking functions failed to check\nwhether a file had been opened on the server before performing locking\noperations on it. A local, unprivileged user on a system with an NFSv4\nshare mounted could possibly use this flaw to cause a kernel panic (denial\nof service) or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2009-3726, Important)\n* a flaw was found in the sctp_process_unk_param() function in the Linux\nkernel Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation. A remote\nattacker could send a specially-crafted SCTP packet to an SCTP listening\nport on a target system, causing a kernel panic (denial of service).\n(CVE-2010-1173, Important)\n* a race condition between finding a keyring by name and destroying a freed\nkeyring was found in the Linux kernel key management facility. A local,\nunprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a kernel panic (denial of\nservice) or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2010-1437, Important)\nRed Hat would like to thank Simon Vallet for responsibly reporting\nCVE-2009-3726; and Jukka Taimisto and Olli Jarva of Codenomicon Ltd, Nokia\nSiemens Networks, and Wind River on behalf of their customer, for\nresponsibly reporting CVE-2010-1173.\nBug fixes:\n* RHBA-2007:0791 introduced a regression in the Journaling Block Device\n(JBD). Under certain circumstances, removing a large file (such as 300 MB\nor more) did not result in inactive memory being freed, leading to the\nsystem having a large amount of inactive memory. Now, the memory is\ncorrectly freed. (BZ#589155)\n* the timer_interrupt() routine did not scale lost real ticks to logical\nticks correctly, possibly causing time drift for 64-bit Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux 4 KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) guests that were booted with the\n\"divider=x\" kernel parameter set to a value greater than 1. \"warning: many\nlost ticks\" messages may have been logged on the affected guest systems.\n(BZ#590551)\n* a bug could have prevented NFSv3 clients from having the most up-to-date\nfile attributes for files on a given NFSv3 file system. In cases where a\nfile type changed, such as if a file was removed and replaced with a\ndirectory of the same name, the NFSv3 client may not have noticed this\nchange until stat(2) was called (for example, by running \"ls -l\").\n(BZ#596372)\n* RHBA-2007:0791 introduced bugs in the Linux kernel PCI-X subsystem. These\ncould have caused a system deadlock on some systems where the BIOS set the\ndefault Maximum Memory Read Byte Count (MMRBC) to 4096, and that also use\nthe Intel PRO/1000 Linux driver, e1000. Errors such as \"e1000: eth[x]:\ne1000_clean_tx_irq: Detected Tx Unit Hang\" were logged. (BZ#596374)\n* an out of memory condition in a KVM guest, using the virtio-net network\ndriver and also under heavy network stress, could have resulted in\nthat guest being unable to receive network traffic. Users had to manually\nremove and re-add the virtio_net module and restart the network service\nbefore networking worked as expected. Such memory conditions no longer\nprevent KVM guests receiving network traffic. (BZ#597310)\n* when an SFQ qdisc that limited the queue size to two packets was added to\na network interface, sending traffic through that interface resulted in a\nkernel crash. Such a qdisc no longer results in a kernel crash. (BZ#597312)\n* when an NFS client opened a file with the O_TRUNC flag set, it received\na valid stateid, but did not use that stateid to perform the SETATTR call.\nSuch cases were rejected by Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 NFS servers with an\n\"NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID\" error, possibly preventing some NFS clients from\nwriting files to an NFS file system. (BZ#597314)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
