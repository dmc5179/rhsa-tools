A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\nbase score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the\nCVE link in the References section.","JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business\nprocess automation infrastructure. JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform allows IT\nto leverage existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future\n(EDA and CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business\nprocess execution speed and quality.\nAn input sanitization flaw was found in the way JBoss Drools implemented\ncertain rule base serialization. If a remote attacker supplied\nspecially-crafted input to a JBoss Seam based application that accepts\nserialized input, it could lead to arbitrary code execution with the\nprivileges of the JBoss server process. (CVE-2010-3708)\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 4.2 and 4.3 as provided from the\nRed Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this patch.
