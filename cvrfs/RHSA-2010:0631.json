Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.\n[Updated 18 August 2010]\nThe CVE-2010-2240 description has been updated to reflect that the issue\naffects both 32-bit and 64-bit systems. No changes have been made to the\npackages.","These packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating\nsystem.\nSecurity fixes:\n* unsafe sprintf() use in the Bluetooth implementation. Creating a large\nnumber of Bluetooth L2CAP, SCO, or RFCOMM sockets could result in arbitrary\nmemory pages being overwritten, allowing a local, unprivileged user to\ncause a denial of service or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2010-1084,\nImportant)\n* a flaw in the Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation implementation,\nallowing a remote attacker to send a specially-crafted ISO MPEG-2 Transport\nStream frame to a target system, resulting in a denial of service.\n(CVE-2010-1086, Important)\n* NULL pointer dereference in nfs_wb_page_cancel(), allowing a local user\non a system that has an NFS-mounted file system to cause a denial of\nservice or escalate their privileges on that system. (CVE-2010-1087,\nImportant)\n* flaw in sctp_process_unk_param(), allowing a remote attacker to send a\nspecially-crafted SCTP packet to an SCTP listening port on a target system,\ncausing a denial of service. (CVE-2010-1173, Important)\n* race condition between finding a keyring by name and destroying a freed\nkeyring in the key management facility, allowing a local, unprivileged\nuser to cause a denial of service or escalate their privileges.\n(CVE-2010-1437, Important)\n* systems using the kernel NFS server to export a shared memory file system\nand that have the sysctl overcommit_memory variable set to never overcommit\n(a value of 2; by default, it is set to 0), may experience a NULL pointer\ndereference, allowing a local, unprivileged user to cause a denial of\nservice or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2008-7256, CVE-2010-1643,\nImportant)\n* when an application has a stack overflow, the stack could silently\noverwrite another memory mapped area instead of a segmentation fault\noccurring, which could cause an application to execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2010-2240, Important)\n* flaw in CIFSSMBWrite() could allow a remote attacker to send a\nspecially-crafted SMB response packet to a target CIFS client, resulting in\na denial of service. (CVE-2010-2248, Important)\n* buffer overflow flaws in the kernel's implementation of the server-side\nXDR for NFSv4 could allow an attacker on the local network to send a\nspecially-crafted large compound request to the NFSv4 server, possibly\nresulting in a denial of service or code execution. (CVE-2010-2521,\nImportant)\n* NULL pointer dereference in the firewire-ohci driver used for OHCI\ncompliant IEEE 1394 controllers could allow a local, unprivileged user with\naccess to /dev/fw* files to issue certain IOCTL calls, causing a denial of\nservice or privilege escalation. The FireWire modules are blacklisted by\ndefault. If enabled, only root has access to the files noted above by\ndefault. (CVE-2009-4138, Moderate)\n* flaw in the link_path_walk() function. Using the file descriptor\nreturned by open() with the O_NOFOLLOW flag on a subordinate NFS-mounted\nfile system, could result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing a denial\nof service or privilege escalation. (CVE-2010-1088, Moderate)\n* memory leak in release_one_tty() could allow a local, unprivileged user\nto cause a denial of service. (CVE-2010-1162, Moderate)\n* information leak in the USB implementation. Certain USB errors could\nresult in an uninitialized kernel buffer being sent to user-space. An\nattacker with physical access to a target system could use this flaw to\ncause an information leak.
