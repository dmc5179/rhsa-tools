An\nattacker could use this to perform cross-site scripting attacks against\nsites that have publicly-available PHP scripts that call phpinfo().\n(CVE-2006-0996)\nThe error handling output was found to not properly escape HTML output in\ncertain cases. An attacker could use this flaw to perform cross-site\nscripting attacks against sites where both display_errors and html_errors\nare enabled. (CVE-2006-0208) \nA buffer overflow flaw was discovered in uw-imap, the University of\nWashington's IMAP Server. php-imap is compiled against the static c-client\nlibraries from imap and therefore needed to be recompiled against the fixed\nversion. (CVE-2005-2933)\nThe wordwrap() PHP function did not properly check for integer overflow in\nthe handling of the \"break\" parameter.  An attacker who could control the\nstring passed to the \"break\" parameter could cause a heap overflow. \n(CVE-2006-1990)\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches that resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
