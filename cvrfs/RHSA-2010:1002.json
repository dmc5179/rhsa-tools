A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,\nwhich gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in\nthe References section.","The mod_auth_mysql package includes an extension module for the Apache HTTP\nServer, which can be used to implement web user authentication against a\nMySQL database.\nA flaw was found in the way mod_auth_mysql escaped certain\nmultibyte-encoded strings. If mod_auth_mysql was configured to use a\nmultibyte character set that allowed a backslash (\"\\\") as part of the\ncharacter encodings, a remote attacker could inject arbitrary SQL commands\ninto a login request. (CVE-2008-2384)\nNote: This flaw only affected non-default installations where\nAuthMySQLCharacterSet is configured to use one of the affected multibyte\ncharacter sets. Installations that did not use the AuthMySQLCharacterSet\nconfiguration option were not vulnerable to this flaw.\nAll mod_auth_mysql users are advised to upgrade to this updated package,\nwhich contains a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing\nthe updated package, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to\ntake effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
