A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\nbase score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the\nCVE link in the References section.","The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\nThis update fixes the following security issue:\n* a use-after-free flaw was found in the tcp_rcv_state_process() function\nin the Linux kernel TCP/IP protocol suite implementation. If a system using\nIPv6 had the IPV6_RECVPKTINFO option set on a listening socket, a remote\nattacker could send an IPv6 packet to that system, causing a kernel panic\n(denial of service). (CVE-2010-1188, Important)\nThis update also adds the following enhancement:\n* kernel support for the iptables connlimit module. This module can be used\nto help mitigate some types of denial of service attacks. Note: This update\nalone does not address connlimit support. A future iptables package update\nwill allow connlimit to work correctly. (BZ#563222)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct this issue and add this enhancement. The system must be\nrebooted for this update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
