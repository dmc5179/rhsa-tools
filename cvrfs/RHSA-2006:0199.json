If a user visits a malicious web page, Mozilla could\ncrash or execute arbitrary code as the user running Mozilla. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the name CVE-2006-0292 to\nthis issue.\nmoz_bug_r_a4 discovered a bug in Mozilla's XULDocument.persist() function.\nA malicious web page could inject arbitrary RDF data into a user's\nlocalstore.rdf file, which can cause Mozilla to execute arbitrary\njavascript when a user runs Mozilla.  (CVE-2006-0296)\nA denial of service bug was found in the way Mozilla saves history\ninformation. If a user visits a web page with a very long title, it is\npossible Mozilla will crash or take a very long time the next time it is\nrun.  (CVE-2005-4134)\nNote that the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 packages also fix a bug when\nusing XSLT to transform documents. Passing DOM Nodes as parameters to\nfunctions expecting an xsl:param could cause Mozilla to throw an exception.\nUsers of Mozilla are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
