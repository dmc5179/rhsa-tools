A remote attacker could cause the PHP interpreter to crash by\nsubmitting an input variable with a deeply nested array. (CVE-2007-1285)\nA flaw was found in the way the mbstring extension set global variables. A\nscript which used the mb_parse_str() function to set global variables could\nbe forced to enable the register_globals configuration option, possibly\nresulting in global variable injection. (CVE-2007-1583)\nA flaw was discovered in the way PHP's mail() function processed header\ndata. If a script sent mail using a Subject header containing a string from\nan untrusted source, a remote attacker could send bulk e-mail to unintended\nrecipients. (CVE-2007-1718)\nA heap based buffer overflow flaw was discovered in PHP's gd extension. A\nscript that could be forced to process WBMP images from an untrusted source\ncould result in arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2007-1001)\nA buffer over-read flaw was discovered in PHP's gd extension. A script that\ncould be forced to write arbitrary strings using a JIS font from an\nuntrusted source could cause the PHP interpreter to crash. (CVE-2007-0455)\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
