A remote unauthenticated attacker who can access\nkadmind could trigger this flaw and cause kadmind to crash or potentially\nexecute arbitrary code as root. (CVE-2007-2442)\nDavid Coffey also discovered an overflow flaw in the RPC library used by\nkadmind. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux, exploitation of this flaw is limited\nto a denial of service. A remote unauthenticated attacker who can access\nkadmind could trigger this flaw and cause kadmind to crash. (CVE-2007-2443)\nA stack buffer overflow flaw was found in kadmind. An authenticated\nattacker who can access kadmind could trigger this flaw and potentially\nexecute arbitrary code on the Kerberos server. (CVE-2007-2798)\nFor Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, several portability bugs which would lead\nto unexpected crashes on the ia64 platform have also been fixed.\nUsers of krb5-server are advised to update to these erratum packages which\ncontain backported fixes to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
