A script\nthat could be forced to resize images from an untrusted source could\npossibly allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code as the apache\nuser. (CVE-2007-3996)\nAn integer overflow flaw was found in the PHP chunk_split function. If a\nremote attacker was able to pass arbitrary data to the third argument of\nchunk_split they could possibly execute arbitrary code as the apache user.\nNote that it is unusual for a PHP script to use the chunk_script function\nwith a user-supplied third argument. (CVE-2007-2872)\nA previous security update introduced a bug into PHP session cookie\nhandling. This could allow an attacker to stop a victim from viewing a\nvulnerable web site if the victim has first visited a malicious web page\nunder the control of the attacker, and that page can set a cookie for the\nvulnerable web site. (CVE-2007-4670)\nA flaw was found in the PHP money_format function. If a remote attacker\nwas able to pass arbitrary data to the money_format function this could\npossibly result in an information leak or denial of service. Note that is\nis unusual for a PHP script to pass user-supplied data to the money_format\nfunction. (CVE-2007-4658)\nA flaw was found in the PHP wordwrap function. If a remote attacker was\nable to pass arbitrary data to the wordwrap function this could possibly\nresult in a denial of service. (CVE-2007-3998)\nA bug was found in PHP session cookie handling. This could allow an\nattacker to create a cross-site cookie insertion attack if a victim follows\nan untrusted carefully-crafted URL. (CVE-2007-3799)\nAn infinite-loop flaw was discovered in the PHP gd extension. A script\nthat could be forced to process PNG images from an untrusted source could\nallow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2007-2756)\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
