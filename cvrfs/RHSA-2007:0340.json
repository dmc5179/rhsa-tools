This could allow attackers to poison a web-cache, bypass web\napplication firewall protection, or conduct cross-site scripting attacks. \n(CVE-2005-2090)\nTomcat permitted various characters as path delimiters. If Tomcat was used\nbehind certain proxies and configured to only proxy some contexts, an\nattacker could construct an HTTP request to work around the context\nrestriction and potentially access non-proxied content. (CVE-2007-0450)\nSeveral applications distributed in the JSP examples displayed unfiltered\nvalues. If the JSP examples are accessible, these flaws could allow a\nremote attacker to perform cross-site scripting attacks. (CVE-2005-4838,\nCVE-2006-7195, CVE-2006-7196)\nThe default Tomcat configuration permitted the use of insecure\nSSL cipher suites including the anonymous cipher suite. (CVE-2007-1858)\nDirectory listings were enabled by default in Tomcat. Information stored\nunprotected under the document root was visible to anyone if the\nadministrator did not disable directory listings. (CVE-2006-3835)\nIt was found that generating listings of large directories was CPU\nintensive.  An attacker could make repeated requests to obtain a directory\nlisting of any large directory, leading to a denial of service. \n(CVE-2005-3510)\nUsers should upgrade to these erratum packages which contain an update to\nTomcat and the addition of backported security patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
