PHP\napplications use the unserialize function on untrusted user data, which\ncould allow a remote attacker to gain access to memory or potentially\nexecute arbitrary code.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1019 to this issue.\nFlaws were found in the pack and unpack PHP functions. These functions\ndo not normally pass user supplied data, so they would require a malicious\nPHP script to be exploited. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1018 to this issue.\nA bug was discovered in the initialization of the OpenSSL library, such\nthat the curl extension could not be used to perform HTTP requests over SSL\nunless the php-imap package was installed.\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain fixes\nfor these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
