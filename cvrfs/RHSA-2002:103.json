On some platforms this can be remotely\nexploited -- allowing arbitrary code to be run on the server.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0392 to this issue.\nWe have backported the security fix from the official Apache 1.3.26\nrelease. This should help minimize the impact of upgrading to our errata\npackages.\nAll users of Apache should update to these errata packages to correct this\nsecurity issue.\n[Update Jun 26 2002]\nUpdated packages have been added for Red Hat Linux for S/390.
