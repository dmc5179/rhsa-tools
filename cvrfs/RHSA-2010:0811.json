Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.","The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing layer\nfor UNIX operating systems.\nA use-after-free flaw was found in the way the CUPS server parsed Internet\nPrinting Protocol (IPP) packets. A malicious user able to send IPP requests\nto the CUPS server could use this flaw to crash the CUPS server or,\npotentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the CUPS server.\n(CVE-2010-2941)\nA possible privilege escalation flaw was found in CUPS. An unprivileged\nprocess running as the \"lp\" user (such as a compromised external filter\nprogram spawned by the CUPS server) could trick the CUPS server into\noverwriting arbitrary files as the root user. (CVE-2010-2431)\nRed Hat would like to thank Emmanuel Bouillon of NATO C3 Agency for\nreporting the CVE-2010-2941 issue.\nUsers of cups are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this\nupdate, the cupsd daemon will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
