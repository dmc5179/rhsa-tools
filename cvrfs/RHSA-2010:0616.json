A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,\nwhich gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in\nthe References section.","dbus-glib is an add-on library to integrate the standard D-Bus library with\nthe GLib main loop and threading model. NetworkManager is a network link\nmanager that attempts to keep a wired or wireless network connection active\nat all times.\nIt was discovered that dbus-glib did not enforce the \"access\" flag on\nexported GObject properties. If such a property were read/write internally\nbut specified as read-only externally, a malicious, local user could use\nthis flaw to modify that property of an application. Such a change could\nimpact the application's behavior (for example, if an IP address were\nchanged the network may not come up properly after reboot) and possibly\nlead to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-1172)\nDue to the way dbus-glib translates an application's XML definitions of\nservice interfaces and properties into C code at application build time,\napplications built against dbus-glib that use read-only properties needed\nto be rebuilt to fully fix the flaw. As such, this update provides\nNetworkManager packages that have been rebuilt against the updated\ndbus-glib packages. No other applications shipped with Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux 5 were affected.\nAll dbus-glib and NetworkManager users are advised to upgrade to these\nupdated packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.\nRunning instances of NetworkManager must be restarted (service\nNetworkManager restart) for this update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
