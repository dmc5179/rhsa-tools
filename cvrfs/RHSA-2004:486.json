If\na user is tricked into dragging a javascript link into another frame or\npage, it becomes possible for an attacker to steal or modify sensitive\ninformation from that site.  Additionally, if a user is tricked into\ndragging two links in sequence to another window (not frame), it is\npossible for the attacker to execute arbitrary commands.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0905 to this issue.\nGael Delalleau discovered an integer overflow which affects the BMP\nhandling code inside Mozilla. An attacker could create a carefully crafted\nBMP file in such a way that it would cause Mozilla to crash or execute\narbitrary code when the image is viewed.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0904 to\nthis issue.\nGeorgi Guninski discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the vCard\ndisplay routines.  An attacker could create a carefully crafted vCard file\nin such a way that it would cause Mozilla to crash or execute arbitrary\ncode when viewed.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0903 to this issue.\nWladimir Palant discovered a flaw in the way javascript interacts with\nthe clipboard.  It is possible that an attacker could use malicious\njavascript code to steal sensitive data which has been copied into the\nclipboard.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0908 to this issue.\nGeorgi Guninski discovered a heap based buffer overflow in the \"Send\nPage\" feature.  It is possible that an attacker could construct a link in\nsuch a way that a user attempting to forward it could result in a crash or\narbitrary code execution.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0902 to this issue.\nUsers of Mozilla should update to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches and are not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
