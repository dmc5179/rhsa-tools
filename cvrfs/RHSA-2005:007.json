An attacker could create a specially\ncrafted archive which could cause unarj to crash or possibly execute\narbitrary code when extracted by a victim.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0947 to\nthis issue.\nAdditionally, a path traversal vulnerability was discovered in unarj.  An\nattacker could create a specially crafted archive which would create files\nin the parent (\"..\") directory when extracted by a victim.  When used\nrecursively, this vulnerability could be used to overwrite critical system\nfiles and programs.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1027 to this issue.\nUsers of unarj should upgrade to this updated package which contains\nbackported patches and is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
