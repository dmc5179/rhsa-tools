Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of\nup2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be\ndownloaded directly from the RHN website:\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006:0354"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Low","type":"Impact"}},"discovery_date":"2005-05-04T00:00:00Z","ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated elfutils packages that address a minor security issue and various\nother issues are now available.\nThis update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat\nSecurity Response Team.","The elfutils packages contain a number of utility programs and libraries\nrelated to the creation and maintenance of executable code.\nThe elfutils packages that originally shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4\nwere GPL-licensed versions which lacked some functionality. Previous\nupdates provided fully functional versions of elfutils only under the OSL\nlicense. This update provides a fully functional, GPL-licensed version of\nelfutils. \nIn the OSL-licensed elfutils versions provided in previous updates, some\ntools could sometimes crash when given corrupted input files.  (CVE-2005-1704)\nAlso, when the eu-strip tool was used to create separate debuginfo files\nfrom relocatable objects such as kernel modules (.ko), the resulting\ndebuginfo files (.ko.debug) were sometimes corrupted.  Both of these\nproblems are fixed in the new version.\nUsers of elfutils should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve\nthese issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
