A remote attacker who can access the telnet port of a target\nmachine could log in as root without requiring a password.  (CVE-2007-0956)\nNote that the krb5 telnet daemon is not enabled by default in any version\nof Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  In addition, the default firewall rules block\nremote access to the telnet port.  This flaw does not affect the telnet\ndaemon distributed in the telnet-server package.\nFor users who have enabled the krb5 telnet daemon and have it accessible\nremotely, this update should be applied immediately.  \nWhilst we are not aware at this time that the flaw is being actively\nexploited, we have confirmed that the flaw is very easily exploitable.\nThis update also fixes two additional security issues:\nBuffer overflows were found which affect the Kerberos KDC and the kadmin\nserver daemon.  A remote attacker who can access the KDC could exploit this\nbug to run arbitrary code with the privileges of the KDC or kadmin server\nprocesses.  (CVE-2007-0957)\nA double-free flaw was found in the GSSAPI library used by the kadmin\nserver daemon.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 contain checks within\nglibc that detect double-free flaws. Therefore, on Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n4 and 5 successful exploitation of this issue can only lead to a denial of\nservice.  Applications which use this library in earlier releases of Red\nHat Enterprise Linux may also be affected.  (CVE-2007-1216)\nAll users are advised to update to these erratum packages which contain a\nbackported fix to correct these issues.\nRed Hat would like to thank MIT and iDefense for reporting these\nvulnerabilities.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
