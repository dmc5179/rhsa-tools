A web page containing malicious content could cause\nSeaMonkey to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code as the user\nrunning SeaMonkey. (CVE-2007-5338, CVE-2007-5339, CVE-2007-5340)\nSeveral flaws were found in the way in which SeaMonkey displayed malformed\nweb content. A web page containing specially-crafted content could\npotentially trick a user into surrendering sensitive information. \n(CVE-2007-1095, CVE-2007-3844, CVE-2007-3511, CVE-2007-5334)\nA flaw was found in the SeaMonkey sftp protocol handler. A malicious web\npage could access data from a remote sftp site, possibly stealing sensitive\nuser data. (CVE-2007-5337)\nA request-splitting flaw was found in the way in which SeaMonkey generates\na digest authentication request. If a user opened a specially-crafted URL,\nit was possible to perform cross-site scripting attacks, web cache\npoisoning, or other, similar exploits. (CVE-2007-2292)\nUsers of SeaMonkey are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain backported patches that correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
