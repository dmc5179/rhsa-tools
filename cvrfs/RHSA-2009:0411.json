An unprivileged,\nlocal user could use this flaw to send commands to multipathd, resulting in\naccess disruptions to storage devices accessible via multiple paths and,\npossibly, file system corruption on these devices. (CVE-2009-0115)\nUsers of device-mapper-multipath are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain a backported patch to resolve this issue. The\nmultipathd service must be restarted for the changes to take effect.\nImportant: the version of the multipathd daemon in Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n5 has a known issue which may cause a machine to become unresponsive when\nthe multipathd service is stopped. This issue is tracked in the Bugzilla\nbug #494582; a link is provided in the References section of this erratum.\nUntil this issue is resolved, we recommend restarting the multipathd\nservice by issuing the following commands in sequence:\n# killall -KILL multipathd\n# service multipathd restart","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
