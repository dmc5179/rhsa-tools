(CVE-2008-1952)\nA flaw was found in the QEMU block format auto-detection, when running\nfully-virtualized guests and using Qemu images written on removable media\n(USB storage, 3.5\" disks). Privileged users of such fully-virtualized\nguests (DomU), with a raw-formatted disk image, were able to write a header\nto that disk image describing another format. This could allow such guests\nto read arbitrary files in their hypervisor's host (Dom0). (CVE-2008-1945)\nAdditionally, the following bug is addressed in this update:\n* The qcow-create command terminated when invoked due to glibc bounds\nchecking on the realpath() function.\nUsers of xen are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\nresolve these security issues and fix this bug.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
