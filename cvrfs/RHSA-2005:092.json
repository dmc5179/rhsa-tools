These flaws could allow a local user to cause a denial of\nservice (crash) or potentially gain privileges.  Where multicast\napplications are being used on a system, these flaws may also allow remote\nusers to cause a denial of service.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1137 to\nthis issue.\niSEC Security Research discovered a flaw in the page fault handler code\nthat could lead to local users gaining elevated (root) privileges on\nmultiprocessor machines.  (CAN-2005-0001)\niSEC Security Research discovered a VMA handling flaw in the uselib(2)\nsystem call of the Linux kernel.  A local user could make use of this\nflaw to gain elevated (root) privileges.  (CAN-2004-1235)\nA flaw affecting the OUTS instruction on the AMD64 and Intel EM64T\narchitecture was discovered.  A local user could use this flaw to write to\nprivileged IO ports.  (CAN-2005-0204)\nThe Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) driver in Linux kernel 2.6 does not\nproperly check the DMA lock, which could allow remote attackers or local\nusers to cause a denial of service (X Server crash) or possibly modify the\nvideo output. (CAN-2004-1056)\nOGAWA Hirofumi discovered incorrect tables sizes being used in the\nfilesystem Native Language Support ASCII translation table.  This could\nlead to a denial of service (system crash).  (CAN-2005-0177)\nMichael Kerrisk discovered a flaw in the 2.6.9 kernel which allows users to\nunlock arbitrary shared memory segments.  This flaw could lead to\napplications not behaving as expected.  (CAN-2005-0176)\nImprovements in the POSIX signal and tty standards compliance exposed\na race condition.  This flaw can be triggered accidentally by threaded\napplications or deliberately by a malicious user and can result in a\ndenial of service (crash) or in occasional cases give access to a small\nrandom chunk of kernel memory.  (CAN-2005-0178)\nThe PaX team discovered a flaw in mlockall introduced in the 2.6.9 kernel.\nAn unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service\n(CPU and memory consumption or crash).  (CAN-2005-0179)\nBrad Spengler discovered multiple flaws in sg_scsi_ioctl in the 2.6 kernel.\nAn unprivileged user may be able to use this flaw to cause a denial of\nservice (crash) or possibly other actions.  (CAN-2005-0180)\nKirill Korotaev discovered a missing access check regression in the Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 4 kernel 4GB/4GB split patch.
