MySQL is a\nclient/server implementation consisting of a server daemon (mysqld)\nand many different client programs and libraries.\nAn insecure temporary file handling bug was found in the mysql_install_db\nscript. It is possible for a local user to create specially crafted files\nin /tmp which could allow them to execute arbitrary SQL commands during\ndatabase installation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-1636 to this issue.\nThese packages update mysql to version 4.1.12, fixing a number of problems.\nAlso, support for SSL-encrypted connections to the database server is now\nprovided.\nAll users of mysql are advised to upgrade to these updated packages.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
