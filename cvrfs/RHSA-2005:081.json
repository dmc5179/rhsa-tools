A local user could cause these utilities to overwrite\nfiles that the victim running the utility has write access to.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the name CAN-2004-0967 to\nthis issue.\nAdditionally, this update addresses the following issue:\nA problem has been identified in the PDF output driver, which can cause\noutput to be delayed indefinitely on some systems.  The fix has been\nbackported from GhostScript 7.07.\nAll users of ghostscript should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
