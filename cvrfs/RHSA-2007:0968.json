If an application linked against pcre, such as Konqueror,\nparses a malicious regular expression, it may be possible to run arbitrary\ncode as the user running the application. (CVE-2007-1660)\nUsers of pcre are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues.\nRed Hat would like to thank Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry for properly\ndisclosing these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
