A\nremote attacker could use this flaw to create connections to services on\nmachines other than the one that the applet was downloaded from.\n(CVE-2007-5232)\nUntrusted Java Applets were able to drag and drop a file to a Desktop\nApplication. A user-assisted remote attacker could use this flaw to move or\ncopy arbitrary files. (CVE-2007-5239)\nThe Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allowed untrusted Java Applets or\napplications to display oversized windows. This could be used by remote\nattackers to hide security warning banners. (CVE-2007-5240)\nUnsigned Java Applets communicating via a HTTP proxy could allow a remote\nattacker to violate the Java security model. A cached, malicious Applet\ncould create network connections to services on other machines. (CVE-2007-5273)\nTwo vulnerabilities in the Java Runtime Environment allowed an untrusted\napplication or applet to elevate the assigned privileges. This could be\nmisused by a malicious website to read and write local files or execute\nlocal applications in the context of the user running the Java process.\n(CVE-2008-0657)\nThose vulnerabilities concerned with applets can only be triggered in\njava-1.5.0-bea by calling the 'appletviewer' application. \nAll users of java-1.5.0-bea should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain the BEA WebLogic JRockit 1.5.0_14 release that resolves these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
