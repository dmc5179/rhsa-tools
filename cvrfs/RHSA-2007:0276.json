A new user's\nmailbox, when created, could have random permissions for a short period.\nThis could allow a local attacker to read or modify the mailbox.\n(CVE-2006-1174)\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n* shadow-utils debuginfo package was empty.\n* faillog was unusable on 64-bit systems. It checked every UID from 0 to\nthe max UID, which was an excessively large number on 64-bit systems.\n* typo bug in login.defs file\nAll users of shadow-utils are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain backported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
