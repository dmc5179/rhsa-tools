An authenticated user could execute a sequence of\ncommands which could crash the PostgreSQL server or possibly read from\narbitrary memory locations. A user would need to have permissions to drop\nand add database tables to be able to exploit these issues (CVE-2007-0555,\nCVE-2007-0556).\nSeveral denial of service flaws were found in the PostgreSQL server.  An\nauthenticated user could execute certain SQL commands which could crash the\nPostgreSQL server (CVE-2006-5540, CVE-2006-5541, CVE-2006-5542).\nUsers of PostgreSQL should upgrade to these updated packages containing\nPostgreSQL version 8.1.8 which corrects these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
