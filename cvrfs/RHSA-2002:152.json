PNG\nis a bit-mapped graphics format similar to the GIF format.\nVersions of libpng prior to 1.0.14 contain a buffer overflow in the\nprogressive reader when the PNG datastream contains more IDAT data than\nindicated by the IHDR chunk. Such deliberately malformed datastreams would\ncrash applications linked to libpng such as Mozilla that use the\nprogressive reading feature.\nPackages within Red Hat Linux Advanced Server , such as Mozilla, make use\nof the shared libpng library, therefore all users are advised to upgrade to\nthe errata packages which contain libpng 1.0.14. Libpng 1.0.14 is not\nvulnerable to this issue and contains fixes for other bugs including a\nnumber of memory leaks.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
