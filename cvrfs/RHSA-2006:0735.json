A malicious HTML mail message could cause the execution of\nJavascript code in such a way that could cause Thunderbird to crash or\nexecute arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2006-5463,\nCVE-2006-5747, CVE-2006-5748)\nSeveral flaws were found in the way Thunderbird renders HTML mail messages.\nA malicious HTML mail message could cause the mail client to crash or\npossibly execute arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird.\n(CVE-2006-5464)\nA flaw was found in the way Thunderbird verifies RSA signatures. For RSA\nkeys with exponent 3 it is possible for an attacker to forge a signature\nthat would be incorrectly verified by the NSS library. Thunderbird as\nshipped trusts several root Certificate Authorities that use exponent 3. An\nattacker could have created a carefully crafted SSL certificate which would\nbe incorrectly trusted when their site was visited by a victim. This flaw\nwas previously thought to be fixed in Thunderbird 1.5.0.7, however Ulrich\nKuehn discovered the fix was incomplete (CVE-2006-5462)\nUsers of Thunderbird are advised to upgrade to this update, which contains\nThunderbird version 1.5.0.8 that corrects these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
