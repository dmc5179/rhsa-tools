A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,\nwhich gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in\nthe References section.","The RPM Package Manager (RPM) is a command line driven package management\nsystem capable of installing, uninstalling, verifying, querying, and\nupdating software packages.\nIt was discovered that RPM did not remove setuid and setgid bits set on\nbinaries when upgrading packages. A local attacker able to create hard\nlinks to binaries could use this flaw to keep those binaries on the system,\nat a specific version level and with the setuid or setgid bit set, even if\nthe package providing them was upgraded by a system administrator. This\ncould have security implications if a package was upgraded because of a\nsecurity flaw in a setuid or setgid program. (CVE-2010-2059)\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n* A memory leak in the communication between RPM and the Security-Enhanced\nLinux (SELinux) subsystem, which could have caused extensive memory\nconsumption. In reported cases, this issue was triggered by running\nrhn_check when errata were scheduled to be applied. (BZ#627630)\nAll users of rpm are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
