A web page containing such malicious content could cause SeaMonkey\nto crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running\nSeaMonkey. (CVE-2008-2801, CVE-2008-2802, CVE-2008-2803)\nSeveral flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web\npage containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,\npotentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running SeaMonkey.\n(CVE-2008-2798, CVE-2008-2799, CVE-2008-2811)\nSeveral flaws were found in the way malformed web content was displayed. A\nweb page containing specially-crafted content could potentially trick a\nSeaMonkey user into surrendering sensitive information. (CVE-2008-2800)\nTwo local file disclosure flaws were found in SeaMonkey. A web page\ncontaining malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to reveal the contents\nof a local file to a remote attacker. (CVE-2008-2805, CVE-2008-2810)\nA flaw was found in the way a malformed .properties file was processed by\nSeaMonkey. A malicious extension could read uninitialized memory, possibly\nleaking sensitive data to the extension. (CVE-2008-2807)\nA flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey escaped a listing of local file\nnames. If a user could be tricked into listing a local directory containing\nmalicious file names, arbitrary JavaScript could be run with the\npermissions of the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2008-2808)\nA flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey displayed information about\nself-signed certificates. It was possible for a self-signed certificate to\ncontain multiple alternate name entries, which were not all displayed to\nthe user, allowing them to mistakenly extend trust to an unknown site.\n(CVE-2008-2809)\nAll SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
