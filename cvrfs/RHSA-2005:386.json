Perepelitsa discovered a bug in the way Mozilla handles\nanonymous functions during regular expression string replacement. It is\npossible for a malicious web page to capture a random block of browser\nmemory. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\nhas assigned the name CAN-2005-0989 to this issue.\nDoron Rosenberg discovered a bug in the way Mozilla displays pop-up\nwindows. If a user choses to open a pop-up window whose URL is malicious\njavascript, the script will be executed with elevated privileges.\n(CAN-2005-1153)\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla handles the javascript global scope for\na window. It is possible for a malicious web page to define a global\nvariable known to be used by a different site, allowing malicious code to\nbe executed in the context of the site. (CAN-2005-1154)\nMichael Krax discovered a bug in the way Mozilla handles favicon links. A\nmalicious web page can programatically define a favicon link tag as\njavascript, executing arbitrary javascript with elevated privileges.\n(CAN-2005-1155)\nMichael Krax discovered a bug in the way Mozilla installed search plugins.\nIf a user chooses to install a search plugin from a malicious site, the new\nplugin could silently overwrite an existing plugin. This could allow the\nmalicious plugin to execute arbitrary code and stealm sensitive\ninformation. (CAN-2005-1156 CAN-2005-1157)\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla validated several XPInstall related\njavascript objects. A malicious web page could pass other objects to the\nXPInstall objects, resulting in the javascript interpreter jumping to\narbitrary locations in memory. (CAN-2005-1159)\nA bug was found in the way the Mozilla privileged UI code handled DOM nodes\nfrom the content window. A malicious web page could install malicious\njavascript code or steal data requiring a user to do commonplace actions\nsuch as clicking a link or opening the context menu. (CAN-2005-1160)\nUsers of Mozilla are advised to upgrade to this updated package which\ncontains Mozilla version 1.7.7 to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
