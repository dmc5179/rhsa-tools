RENAME\" checked\nthe CREATE/INSERT rights of the old table instead of the new one.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2004-0835 to this issue.\nLukasz Wojtow discovered a buffer overrun in the mysql_real_connect\nfunction.  In order to exploit this issue an attacker would need to force\nthe use of a malicious DNS server (CAN-2004-0836).\nDean Ellis discovered that multiple threads ALTERing the same (or\ndifferent) MERGE tables to change the UNION could cause the server to crash\nor stall (CAN-2004-0837).\nSergei Golubchik discovered that if a user is granted privileges to a\ndatabase with a name containing an underscore (\"_\"), the user also gains\nthe ability to grant privileges to other databases with similar names\n(CAN-2004-0957).\nAdditionally, the following minor temporary file vulnerabilities were\ndiscovered:\n- Stan Bubroski and Shaun Colley found a temporary file vulnerability in \nthe mysqlbug script (CAN-2004-0381).\n- A temporary file vulnerability was discovered in mysqld_multi  \n(CAN-2004-0388).\n- Jeroen van Wolffelaar discovered an temporary file vulnerability in the \nmysqlhotcopy script when using the scp method (CAN-2004-0457).\nAll users of mysql should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve\nthese issues and also include fixes for a number of small bugs.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
