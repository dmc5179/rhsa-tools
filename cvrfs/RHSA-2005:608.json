This flaw occurs if a virtual host is configured\nusing \"SSLVerifyClient optional\" and a directive \"SSLVerifyClient\nrequired\" is set for a specific location.  For servers configured in this\nfashion, an attacker may be able to access resources that should otherwise\nbe protected, by not supplying a client certificate when connecting.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the name\nCAN-2005-2700 to this issue.\nA flaw was discovered in Apache httpd where the byterange filter would\nbuffer certain responses into memory.  If a server has a dynamic\nresource such as a CGI script or PHP script that generates a large amount\nof data, an attacker could send carefully crafted requests in order to\nconsume resources, potentially leading to a Denial of Service.  (CAN-2005-2728)\nUsers of Apache httpd should update to these errata packages that contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
