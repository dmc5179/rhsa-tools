Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains \nthe desired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nUsers of Red Hat Linux 6.2 should note that the openldap package has been\nsplit into the openldap, openldap-servers, and openldap-clients packages.\nUsers may need to manually select the openldap-servers and\nopenldap-clients packages to ensure that they are upgraded properly.\nThis update also transitions users of Red Hat Linux 7 to OpenLDAP 2.0,\nwhich uses a different on-disk format for storing the LDBM databases\nwhich are used by slapd, the standalone LDAP server.  Users who are\nrunning an OpenLDAP server will need to dump out their old databases by\nrunning \"ldbmcat -n\" and reload them using the \"slapadd\" command. They\nalso should ensuring that the \"ldap\" user continues to have read/write\naccess to the database files.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2001:098"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated openldap packages are now available for Red Hat Linux 6.2, 7, and\n7.1.
