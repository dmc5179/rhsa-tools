Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscore, which gives detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link\nin the References section.","Apache Camel is a versatile open-source integration framework based on\nknown Enterprise Integration Patterns.\nA flaw was found in Apache Camel's parsing of the FILE_NAME header.\nA remote attacker able to submit messages to a Camel route, which would\nwrite the provided message to a file, could provide expression language\n(EL) expressions in the FILE_NAME header that would be evaluated on the\nserver. This could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the context\nof the Camel server process.
