A script that\ncould be forced to resize images from an untrusted source could possibly\nallow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code as the apache user. \n(CVE-2007-3996)\nAn integer overflow was found in the PHP chunk_split function. If a remote\nattacker was able to pass arbitrary data to the third argument of the\nchunk_split function, they could possibly execute arbitrary code as the\napache user.  Note that it is unusual for a PHP script to use the\nchunk_script function with a user-supplied third argument. (CVE-2007-2872)\nA previous security update introduced a bug into PHP session cookie\nhandling.  This could allow an attacker to stop a victim from viewing a\nvulnerable web site if the victim has first visited a malicious web page\nunder the control of the attacker, and that page can set a cookie for the\nvulnerable web site. (CVE-2007-4670)\nA bug was found in PHP session cookie handling.  This could allow an\nattacker to create a cross-site cookie insertion attack if a victim follows\nan untrusted carefully-crafted URL. (CVE-2007-3799)\nA flaw was found in the PHP 'ftp' extension. If a PHP script used this\nextension to provide access to a private FTP server, and passed untrusted\nscript input directly to any function provided by this extension, a remote\nattacker would be able to send arbitrary FTP commands to the server.\n(CVE-2007-2509)\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
