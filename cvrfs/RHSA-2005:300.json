An attacker could\ncreate a carefully crafted EXIF image file which could cause image viewers\nlinked against libexif to crash. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0664 to this issue.\nUsers of libexif should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a\nbackported patch and are not vulnerable to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
