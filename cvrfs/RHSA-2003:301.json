Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate \nErrors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated \ncertificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat \nFTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003:301"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Moderate","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["An updated mod_ssl package is now available for Stronghold 4 on Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux that closes a security issue in certain rare configurations.","Stronghold 4 contains a number of open source technologies, including the\nmod_ssl module (which provides SSL/TLS support for Apache).\nBen Laurie found a bug in the optional renegotiation code in mod_ssl\nthat can cause cipher suite restrictions to be ignored. This is triggered\nif optional renegotiation is used (SSLOptions +OptRenegotiate) along with\nverification of client certificates and a change to the cipher suite over\nthe renegotiation.
