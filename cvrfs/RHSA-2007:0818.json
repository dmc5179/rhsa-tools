A remote attacker\ncould use this to inject arbitrary web script or HTML. (CVE-2007-3503)\nThe Java Web Start URL parsing component contained a buffer overflow\nvulnerability within the parsing code for JNLP files. A remote attacker\ncould create a malicious JNLP file that could trigger this flaw and execute\narbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2007-3655)\nThe JSSE component did not correctly process SSL/TLS handshake requests. A\nremote attacker who is able to connect to a JSSE-based service could\ntrigger this flaw leading to a denial-of-service. (CVE-2007-3698)\nA flaw was found in the applet class loader. An untrusted applet could use\nthis flaw to circumvent network access restrictions, possibly connecting to\nservices hosted on the machine that executed the applet. (CVE-2007-3922)\nAll users of java-sun-1.5.0 should upgrade to these packages, which contain\nSun Java 1.5.0 Update 12 that corrects these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
