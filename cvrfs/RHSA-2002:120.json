To use Red\nHat Network, launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nAfter upgrading, you should check that the new configuration file is\nactivated. To  do this, type the following command:\ngrep \"X NOT SERVER\" /etc/lpd.perms\nIf this commad returns no output, you will need to put the new\nconfiguration file in place by typing:\nmv /etc/lpd.perms.rpmnew /etc/lpd.perms","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2002:120"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Important","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["The LPRng print spooler, as shipped in Red Hat Linux Advanced Server 2.1,\naccepts all remote print jobs by default. Updated LPRng packages are\navailable to fix this issue.","With its default configuration, LPRng will accept job submissions from\nany host, which is not appropriate in a workstation environment.  We\nare grateful to Matthew Caron for pointing out this configuration\nproblem.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0378 to this issue.\nThe updated packages from this advisory change the job submission\npolicy (in /etc/lpd.perms) so that jobs from remote hosts are refused\nby default.\nThose running print servers may want to adjust this policy as\nappropriate, for example to give access to certain hosts or subnets.\nFor details on how to do this, see the lpd.perms(5) man page.\nPlease note that default installations of Red Hat Linux Advanced Server 2.1\ninclude ipchains rules blocking remote access to the print spooler IP port;\nas a result those installations already reject remote job submissions.   \nNOTE: There are special instructions for installing this update at\nthe end of the \"Solution\" section.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
