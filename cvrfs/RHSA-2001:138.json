Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains\nthe\ndesired RPMs.\nAfter updating the rpms, you will need to restart your print server, by\nrunning:\n/sbin/service lpd restart\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2001:138"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["A collection of security fixes, bug fixes, and functionality updates,\nincluding the Omni print drivers from IBM.","This update addresses the following issues:\nA printing security hole, whereby non-local users could print the contents\nof any file on the system which the 'lp' user was capable of reading. This\nwas solved by giving Ghostscript a 'PARANOIDSAFER' mode, which will not\nopen external files.\nA foomatic printing database bug, which caused all users of the 'stp'\ndriver, including virtually all Epson printers, to fail to print as a\nresult of miscalculated driver data.\nA filtration problem, which caused many PCL and PJL printers to produce\ngarbage. This was solved by switching to the foomatic distributed\n'lpdomatic' program for filtration.\nA few printconf crashers in the new printconf-tui programme.\nAnd in addition, this update adds the Omni print drivers from IBM, which\nsupport an additional 300 printers.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
