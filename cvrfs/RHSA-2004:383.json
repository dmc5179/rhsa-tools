This flaw also applied to glibc\nversions before 2.3.2.  An attacker who is able to send DNS responses\n(perhaps by creating a malicious DNS server) could remotely exploit this\nvulnerability to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2002-0029 to this issue.\nThese updated packages also fix a dlclose function bug on certain shared\nlibraries, which caused program crashes.\nAll users of glibc should upgrade to these updated packages, which\nresolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
