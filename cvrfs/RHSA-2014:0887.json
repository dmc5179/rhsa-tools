A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\nbase score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the\nCVE link in the References section.","JBoss Remoting is a stand-alone project that provides an API for making\nremote invocations using pluggable transports and data marshallers.\nJBoss Application Server 5 and supported Red Hat JBoss 5.x products contain\nJBoss Remoting, which includes a partial implementation of the JMX remoting\nspecification JSR 160. This implementation is provided in jmx-remoting.sar,\nwhich is deployed by default in unsupported community releases of JBoss\nApplication Server 5.x. This implementation does not implement security as\ndefined in JSR 160, and therefore does not apply any authentication or\nauthorization constraints. A remote attacker could use this flaw to\npotentially execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable server. All of the\nsupported Red Hat JBoss 5.x products are not affected by this issue in\ntheir default configuration. These products are only vulnerable if JMX\nremoting is enabled by manually deploying jmx-remoting.sar from the\njboss-as/docs/examples directory. Unsupported community releases of JBoss\nApplication Server 5.x are affected. All users of the standalone JBoss\nRemoting project are also affected. (CVE-2014-3518)\nRed Hat would like to thank Harun ESUR of Sceptive for reporting this\nissue.\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0, Red Hat\nJBoss BRMS 5.3.1, Red Hat JBoss Portal Platform 5.2.2, and Red Hat JBoss\nSOA Platform 5.3.1 as provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal who have\njmx-remoting.sar deployed are advised to follow the instructions provided\nin the Solution section of this advisory.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
