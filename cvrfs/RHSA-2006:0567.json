For PHP scripts that\nrely on the use of the unset() function, a remote attacker could force\nvariable initialization to be bypassed. This would be a security issue\nparticularly for installations that enable the \"register_globals\" setting.\n\"register_globals\" is disabled by default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n(CVE-2006-3017)\nA directory traversal vulnerability was found in PHP. Local users could\nbypass open_basedir restrictions allowing remote attackers to create files\nin arbitrary directories via the tempnam() function. (CVE-2006-1494)\nA flaw was found in the PHP IMAP MIME header decoding function.  An\nattacker could craft a message with an overly long header which caused\nPHP to crash.  (CVE-2002-2214)\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches that resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
