These\nissues only affected users of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2 Extended Update\nSupport as they have already been addressed for users of Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux 5 in the 5.3 update, RHSA-2009:0225.\nIn accordance with the support policy, future security updates to Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 5.2 Extended Update Support will only include issues of\ncritical security impact.\n* when fput() was called to close a socket, the __scm_destroy() function\nin the Linux kernel could make indirect recursive calls to itself. This\ncould, potentially, lead to a denial of service issue. (CVE-2008-5029,\nImportant)\n* the sendmsg() function in the Linux kernel did not block during UNIX\nsocket garbage collection. This could, potentially, lead to a local denial\nof service. (CVE-2008-5300, Important)\n* a flaw was found in the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) subsystem. A\nlocal, unprivileged user could use the flaw to listen on the same socket\nmore than once, possibly causing a denial of service. (CVE-2008-5079,\nImportant)\n* a race condition was found in the Linux kernel \"inotify\" watch removal\nand umount implementation. This could allow a local, unprivileged user\nto cause a privilege escalation or a denial of service. (CVE-2008-5182,\nImportant)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. Note: for this update to take effect, the\nsystem must be rebooted.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
