This allowed a\nlocal user to send arbitrary signals to the suid-process executed by that\nuser. A successful exploitation of this flaw depends on the structure of\nthe suid-program and its signal handling. (CVE-2007-3848, Important)\nA flaw was found in the IPv4 forwarding base. This allowed a local user to\ncause a denial of service. (CVE-2007-2172, Important) \nA flaw was found where a corrupted executable file could cause cross-region\nmemory mappings on Itanium systems. This allowed a local user to cause a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2006-4538, Moderate) \nA flaw was found in the stack expansion when using the hugetlb kernel on\nPowerPC systems. This allowed a local user to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2007-3739, Moderate) \nA flaw was found in the aacraid SCSI driver. This allowed a local user to\nmake ioctl calls to the driver that should be restricted to privileged\nusers. (CVE-2007-4308, Moderate) \nAs well, these updated packages fix the following bug:\n* a bug in the TCP header prediction code may have caused \"TCP: Treason\nuncloaked!\" messages to be logged. In certain situations this may have lead\nto TCP connections hanging or aborting.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 3 users are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain backported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
