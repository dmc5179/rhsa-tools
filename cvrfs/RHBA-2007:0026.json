This system is not meant to replace\nthe need for powerful internet-wide search systems like Lycos, Infoseek,\nWebcrawler and AltaVista. Instead it is meant to cover the search needs for\na single company, campus, or even a particular sub section of a web site. As\nopposed to some WAIS-based or web-server based search engines, htdig can\nspan several web servers at a site. The type of these different web servers\ndoesn't matter as long as they understand the HTTP 1.0 protocol.\nhtdig is also used by KDE to search KDE's HTML documentation.\nBugs fixed in this update include:\n* rundig script (/usr/bin/rundig) missed \"$opts\" on two calls to htfuzzy.\n* htfuzzy segfaulted when database is empty.\n* htdig was unable to open empty database on 64bits.\n* htdig showed full path to configuration file when accessed from the web.\nUsers should upgrade to this updated package, which resolves these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
