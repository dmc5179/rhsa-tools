An\nauthenticated, remote user could send a specially-crafted response that\nwould cause an smbd child process to enter an infinite loop. An\nauthenticated, remote user could use this flaw to exhaust system resources\nby opening multiple CIFS sessions. (CVE-2009-2906)\nAn uninitialized data access flaw was discovered in the smbd daemon when\nusing the non-default \"dos filemode\" configuration option in \"smb.conf\". An\nauthenticated, remote user with write access to a file could possibly use\nthis flaw to change an access control list for that file, even when such\naccess should have been denied. (CVE-2009-1888)\nA flaw was discovered in the way Samba handled users without a home\ndirectory set in the back-end password database (e.g. \"/etc/passwd\"). If a\nshare for the home directory of such a user was created (e.g. using the\nautomated \"[homes]\" share), any user able to access that share could see\nthe whole file system, possibly bypassing intended access restrictions.\n(CVE-2009-2813)\nThe mount.cifs program printed CIFS passwords as part of its debug output\nwhen running in verbose mode. When mount.cifs had the setuid bit set, a\nlocal, unprivileged user could use this flaw to disclose passwords from a\nfile that would otherwise be inaccessible to that user. Note: mount.cifs\nfrom the samba packages distributed by Red Hat does not have the setuid bit\nset. This flaw only affected systems where the setuid bit was manually set\nby an administrator. (CVE-2009-2948)\nUsers of Samba should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues. After installing this update,\nthe smb service will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
