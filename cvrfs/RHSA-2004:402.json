An attacker could create a carefully crafted PNG file in such a\nway that it would cause an application linked with libpng to execute\narbitrary code when the file was opened by a victim.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0597 to these issues.  \nIn addition, this audit discovered a potential NULL pointer dereference in\nlibpng (CAN-2004-0598) and several integer overflow issues (CAN-2004-0599).\nAn attacker could create a carefully crafted PNG file in such a way that\nit would cause an application linked with libpng to crash when the file was\nopened by the victim.\nRed Hat would like to thank Chris Evans for discovering these issues.\nFor users of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 these patches also include a more\ncomplete fix for the out of bounds memory access flaw (CAN-2002-1363). \nAll users are advised to update to the updated libpng packages which\ncontain backported security patches and are not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
