An attacker could use this flaw to\nsend specially-crafted requests that would cause a temporary denial of\nservice. (CVE-2009-0033)\nIt was discovered that the error checking methods of certain authentication\nclasses did not have sufficient error checking, allowing remote attackers\nto enumerate (via brute force methods) usernames registered with\napplications running on Tomcat when FORM-based authentication was used.\n(CVE-2009-0580)\nIt was discovered that web applications containing their own XML parsers\ncould replace the XML parser Tomcat uses to parse configuration files. A\nmalicious web application running on a Tomcat instance could read or,\npotentially, modify the configuration and XML-based data of other web\napplications deployed on the same Tomcat instance. (CVE-2009-0783)\nUsers of Tomcat should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues. Tomcat must be restarted for\nthis update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
