Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0686 to this issue.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux contains a version of pam_smb that is vulnerable\nto this issue, however pam_smb is not enabled by default.\nUsers of pam_smb are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain a patch to version 1.1.6 to correct this issue.\nRed Hat would like to thank Dave Airlie of the Samba team for notifying us\nof this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
