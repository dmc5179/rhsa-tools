On Linux 2.6 kernels, the\nsetuid() call can fail if certain user limits are hit. A local attacker\ncould manipulate their environment in such a way to get the applications to\ncontinue to run as root, potentially leading to an escalation of\nprivileges.  (CVE-2006-3083).\nUsers are advised to update to these erratum packages which contain a\nbackported fix to correct this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
