A remote attacker could use this flaw\nto obtain sensitive information, such as session IDs, and then use this\ninformation for session hijacking attacks. (CVE-2007-5333)\nNote: The fix for the CVE-2007-5333 flaw changes the default cookie\nprocessing behavior: With this update, version 0 cookies that contain\nvalues that must be quoted to be valid are automatically changed to version\n1 cookies. To reactivate the previous, but insecure behavior, add the\nfollowing entry to the \"/etc/tomcat5/catalina.properties\" file:\norg.apache.tomcat.util.http.ServerCookie.VERSION_SWITCH=false\nIt was discovered that request dispatchers did not properly normalize user\nrequests that have trailing query strings, allowing remote attackers to\nsend specially-crafted requests that would cause an information leak.\n(CVE-2008-5515)\nA flaw was found in the way the Tomcat AJP (Apache JServ Protocol)\nconnector processes AJP connections. An attacker could use this flaw to\nsend specially-crafted requests that would cause a temporary denial of\nservice. (CVE-2009-0033)\nIt was discovered that the error checking methods of certain authentication\nclasses did not have sufficient error checking, allowing remote attackers\nto enumerate (via brute force methods) usernames registered with\napplications running on Tomcat when FORM-based authentication was used.\n(CVE-2009-0580)\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the examples calendar\napplication. With some web browsers, remote attackers could use this flaw\nto inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the \"time\" parameter.\n(CVE-2009-0781)\nIt was discovered that web applications containing their own XML parsers\ncould replace the XML parser Tomcat uses to parse configuration files. A\nmalicious web application running on a Tomcat instance could read or,\npotentially, modify the configuration and XML-based data of other web\napplications deployed on the same Tomcat instance. (CVE-2009-0783)\nUsers of Tomcat should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues. Tomcat must be restarted for\nthis update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
