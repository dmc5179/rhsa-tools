If a malicious\nwebsite is able to exhaust a system's memory, it becomes possible to\nexecute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0255 to this issue.\nA bug was found in the way Firefox handles pop-up windows. It is possible\nfor a malicious website to control the content in an unrelated site's\npop-up window. (CAN-2004-1156)\nA bug was found in the way Firefox allows plug-ins to load privileged\ncontent into a frame. It is possible that a malicious webpage could trick a\nuser into clicking in certain places to modify configuration settings or\nexecute arbitrary code. (CAN-2005-0232 and CAN-2005-0527).\nA flaw was found in the way Firefox displays international domain names. It\nis possible for an attacker to display a valid URL, tricking the user into\nthinking they are viewing a legitimate webpage when they are not.\n(CAN-2005-0233)\nA bug was found in the way Firefox handles plug-in temporary files. A\nmalicious local user could create a symlink to a victims directory, causing\nit to be deleted when the victim exits Firefox. (CAN-2005-0578)\nA bug has been found in one of Firefox's UTF-8 converters. It may be\npossible for an attacker to supply a specially crafted UTF-8 string to the\nbuggy converter, leading to arbitrary code execution. (CAN-2005-0592)\nA bug was found in the Firefox javascript security manager. If a user drags\na malicious link to a tab, the javascript security manager is bypassed\nwhich could result in remote code execution or information disclosure.\n(CAN-2005-0231)\nA bug was found in the way Firefox displays the HTTP authentication prompt.\nWhen a user is prompted for authentication, the dialog window is displayed\nover the active tab, regardless of the tab that caused the pop-up to appear\nand could trick a user into entering their username and password for a\ntrusted site.  (CAN-2005-0584)\nA bug was found in the way Firefox displays the save file dialog. It is\npossible for a malicious webserver to spoof the Content-Disposition header,\ntricking the user into thinking they are downloading a different filetype.\n(CAN-2005-0586)\nA bug was found in the way Firefox handles users \"down-arrow\" through auto\ncompleted choices. When an autocomplete choice is selected, the information\nis copied into the input control, possibly allowing a malicious web site to\nsteal information by tricking a user into arrowing through autocompletion\nchoices. (CAN-2005-0589)\nSeveral bugs were found in the way Firefox displays the secure site icon.\nIt is possible that a malicious website could display the secure site icon\nalong with incorrect certificate information. (CAN-2005-0593)\nA bug was found in the way Firefox displays the download dialog window. A\nmalicious site can obfuscate the content displayed in the source field,\ntricking a user into thinking they are downloading content from a trusted\nsource. (CAN-2005-0585)\nA bug was found in the way Firefox handles xsl:include and xsl:import\ndirectives. It is possible for a malicious website to import XSLT\nstylesheets from a domain behind a firewall, leaking information to an\nattacker. (CAN-2005-0588)\nA bug was found in the way Firefox displays the installation confirmation\ndialog. An attacker could add a long user:pass before the true hostname,\ntricking a user into thinking they were installing content from a trusted\nsource. (CAN-2005-0590)\nA bug was found in the way Firefox displays download and security dialogs.\nAn attacker could cover up part of a dialog window tricking the user into\nclicking \"Allow\" or \"Open\", which could potentially lead to arbitrary code\nexecution. (CAN-2005-0591)\nUsers of Firefox are advised to upgrade to this updated package which\ncontains Firefox version 1.0.1 and is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
