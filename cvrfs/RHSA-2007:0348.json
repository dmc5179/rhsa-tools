A\nPHP script which implements an XML-RPC server using this extension\ncould allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code as the 'apache'\nuser.  Note that this flaw does not affect PHP applications using the\npure-PHP XML_RPC class provided in /usr/share/pear. (CVE-2007-1864)\nA flaw was found in the PHP 'ftp' extension.  If a PHP script used this\nextension to provide access to a private FTP server, and passed untrusted\nscript input directly to any function provided by this extension, a remote\nattacker would be able to send arbitrary FTP commands to the server. \n(CVE-2007-2509)\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the PHP 'soap' extension, regarding the\nhandling of an HTTP redirect response when using the SOAP client provided\nby this extension with an untrusted SOAP server.  No mechanism to trigger\nthis flaw remotely is known.  (CVE-2007-2510)\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
