An attacker who has the ability to send a malicious\nPDF file to a printer could possibly execute arbitrary code as the \"lp\"\nuser. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-1125 to this issue.\nA buffer overflow was found in the ParseCommand function in the hpgltops\nprogram. An attacker who has the ability to send a malicious HPGL file to a\nprinter could possibly execute arbitrary code as the \"lp\" user. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-1267 to this issue.\nRed Hat believes that the Exec-Shield technology (enabled by default since\nUpdate 3) will block attempts to exploit these buffer overflow\nvulnerabilities on x86 architectures.\nThe lppasswd utility ignores write errors when modifying the CUPS passwd\nfile.  A local user who is able to fill the associated file system could\ncorrupt the CUPS password file or prevent future uses of lppasswd.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe names CAN-2004-1268 and CAN-2004-1269 to these issues.\nThe lppasswd utility does not verify that the passwd.new file is different\nfrom STDERR, which could allow local users to control output to passwd.new\nvia certain user input that triggers an error message.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-1270 to this issue.\nIn addition to these security issues, two other problems not relating\nto security have been fixed:\nResuming a job with \"lp -H resume\", which had previously been held with \"lp\n-H hold\" could cause the scheduler to stop.  This has been fixed in later\nversions of CUPS, and has been backported in these updated packages.\nThe cancel-cups(1) man page is a symbolic link to another man page.  The\ntarget of this link has been corrected.\nAll users of cups should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve\nthese issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
