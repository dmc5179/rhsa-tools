Enterprise Linux 5.9 Long Life.\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.","The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.\nSecurity Fix(es):\n* An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). There are three primary variants of the issue which differ in the way the speculative execution can be exploited. Variant CVE-2017-5715 triggers the speculative execution by utilizing branch target injection. It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall and guest/host boundaries and read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2017-5715, Important, x86-64)\n* kernel: exec/ptrace: get_dumpable() incorrect tests (CVE-2013-2929, Low)\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\nRed Hat would like to thank Google Project Zero for reporting CVE-2017-5715.\nBug Fix(es):\n* The Return Trampolines (Retpolines) mechanism is a software construct that leverages specific knowledge of the underlying hardware to mitigate the branch target injection, also known as Spectre variant 2 vulnerability described in CVE-2017-5715. With this update, the support for Retpolines has been implemented into the Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.
