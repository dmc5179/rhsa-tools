Enterprise Linux 8.\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.","Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data-structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. For performance, Redis works with an in-memory data set. You can persist it either by dumping the data set to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log.\nSecurity Fix(es):\n* redis: Lua scripts can overflow the heap-based Lua stack (CVE-2021-32626)\n* redis: Integer overflow issue with Streams (CVE-2021-32627)\n* redis: Integer overflow bug in the ziplist data structure (CVE-2021-32628)\n* redis: Denial of service via Redis Standard Protocol (RESP) request (CVE-2021-32675)\n* redis: Integer overflow issue with intsets (CVE-2021-32687)\n* redis: Integer overflow issue with strings (CVE-2021-41099)\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
