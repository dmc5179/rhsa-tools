Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains\nthe\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2002:005"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Versions of xchat prior to version 1.8.7 contain a vulnerability\nwhich allows an attacker to cause a vulnerable client to execute\narbitrary IRC server commands as if the vulnerable user had typed\nthem.\nThis security erratum updates xchat to version 1.8.7, which is\nnot vulnerable to this attack.","xchat is a popular IRC client. Recently xchat has been\nfound to contain a bug in the CTCP PING handling code which can\nbe exploited to execute IRC commands on the IRC server as the\nvulnerable user.  This can be used for example by an attacker\nto /op or /deop, to /kick someone out of a channel, to force the\nvulnerable user out of the channel with a /part, to change\nchannel modes via the /mode command, or to impersonate a user\nvia private /msg commands.\nThis bug does not appear to allow an attacker to execute commands\non the vulnerable computer, just to force IRC server commands to\nbe run as if the vulnerable user had typed them.\nAll previous versions of xchat are vulnerable, however only the 1.4.*\nversions are vulnerable by default.  With later versions (1.6.*, 1.8.*),\nxchat is not vulnerable unless the user has enabled the client side\n\"percascii\" variable with the command \"/set percascii 1\".\nThis security erratum updates xchat to version 1.8.7, for Red Hat Linux\n6.2, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, which is not vulnerable to this attack.  All xchat\nusers should update to this release.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0006 to this issue.\nThanks to zen-parse for discovering and reporting this problem, and\nalso to Marcus Meissner at Caldera for providing a working sample\nexploit with which to easily test for affected versions.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
