SASL is\nthe Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a method for adding\nauthentication support to connection-based protocols.\nA bug was found in cyrus-sasl's DIGEST-MD5 authentication mechanism. As\npart of the DIGEST-MD5 authentication exchange, the client is expected to\nsend a specific set of information to the server. If one of these items\n(the \"realm\") was not sent or was malformed, it was possible for a remote\nunauthenticated attacker to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault)\non the server. (CVE-2006-1721)\nThis errata also fixes the following bugs:\n* the Kerberos 5 library included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 was not\nthread safe. This update adds functionality which allows it to be used\nsafely in a threaded application.\n* several memory leak bugs were fixed in cyrus-sasl's DIGEST-MD5\nauthentication plug-in.\n* /dev/urandom is now used by default on systems which don't support\nhwrandom. Previously, dev/random was the default.\n* cyrus-sasl needs zlib-devel to build properly. This dependency\ninformation is now included in the package.\nUsers are advised to upgrade to this updated cyrus-sasl package, which\nresolves these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
