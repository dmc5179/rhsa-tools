BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver\nlibrary (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and\ntools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.\nA flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message packets\ncontaining the \"ANY\" record type. A remote attacker could use this flaw to\nsend a specially-crafted dynamic update packet that could cause named to\nexit with an assertion failure. (CVE-2009-0696)\nNote: even if named is not configured for dynamic updates, receiving such\na specially-crafted dynamic update packet could still cause named to exit\nunexpectedly.\nAll BIND users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing the\nupdate, the BIND daemon (named) will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
