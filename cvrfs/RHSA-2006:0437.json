This is the eighth\nregular update.\nThis security advisory has been rated as having important security impact\nby the Red Hat Security Response Team.","The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.\nThis is the eighth regular kernel update to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.\nNew features introduced by this update include:\n- addition of the adp94xx and dcdbas device drivers\n- diskdump support on megaraid_sas, qlogic, and swap partitions\n- support for new hardware via driver and SCSI white-list updates\nThere were many bug fixes in various parts of the kernel.  The ongoing\neffort to resolve these problems has resulted in a marked improvement in\nthe reliability and scalability of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.\nThere were numerous driver updates and security fixes (elaborated below).\nOther key areas affected by fixes in this update include the networking\nsubsystem, the NFS and autofs4 file systems, the SCSI and USB subsystems,\nand architecture-specific handling affecting AMD Opteron and Intel EM64T\nprocessors.\nThe following device drivers have been added or upgraded to new versions:\nadp94xx -------- 1.0.8 (new)\nbnx2 ----------- 1.4.38\ncciss ---------- 2.4.60.RH1\ndcdbas --------- 5.6.0-1 (new)\ne1000 ---------- 7.0.33-k2\nemulex --------- 7.3.6\nforcedeth ------ 0.30\nipmi ----------- 35.13\nqlogic --------- 7.07.04b6\ntg3 ------------ 3.52RH\nThe following security bugs were fixed in this update:\n- a flaw in the USB devio handling of device removal that allowed a\nlocal user to cause a denial of service (crash)  (CVE-2005-3055,\nmoderate)\n- a flaw in the exec() handling of multi-threaded tasks using ptrace()\nthat allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (hang of a\nuser process)  (CVE-2005-3107, low)\n- a difference in \"sysretq\" operation of EM64T (as opposed to Opteron)\nprocessors that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service\n(crash) upon return from certain system calls  (CVE-2006-0741 and\nCVE-2006-0744, important)\n- a flaw in unaligned accesses handling on Intel Itanium processors\nthat allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (crash)\n(CVE-2006-0742, important)\n- an info leak on AMD-based x86 and x86_64 systems that allowed a local\nuser to retrieve the floating point exception state of a process\nrun by a different user  (CVE-2006-1056, important)\n- a flaw in IPv4 packet output handling that allowed a remote user to\nbypass the zero IP ID countermeasure on systems with a disabled\nfirewall  (CVE-2006-1242, low)\n- a minor info leak in socket option handling in the network code\n(CVE-2006-1343, low)\n- a flaw in IPv4 netfilter handling for the unlikely use of SNMP NAT\nprocessing that allowed a remote user to cause a denial of service\n(crash) or potential memory corruption  (CVE-2006-2444, moderate)\nNote: The kernel-unsupported package contains various drivers and modules\nthat are unsupported and therefore might contain security problems that\nhave not been addressed.\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 users are advised to upgrade their\nkernels to the packages associated with their machine architectures\nand configurations as listed in this erratum.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
