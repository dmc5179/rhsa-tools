(CVE-2019-17055)\n* kernel: integer overflow in tcp_ack_update_rtt in net/ipv4/tcp_input.c (CVE-2019-18805)\n* kernel: information leak bug caused  by a malicious USB device in the drivers/net/can/usb/peak_usb/pcan_usb_core.c driver (CVE-2019-19534)\n* kernel: some ipv6 protocols not encrypted over ipsec tunnel. (CVE-2020-1749)\n* Kernel: net: using kernel space address bits to derive IP ID may potentially break KASLR (CVE-2019-10639)\n* kernel: An out-of-bounds read in drivers/scsi/qedi/qedi_dbg.c leading to crash or information disclosure (CVE-2019-15090)\n* kernel: a NULL pointer dereference in drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath10k/usb.c leads to a crash (CVE-2019-15099)\n* kernel: Null pointer dereference in the sound/usb/line6/pcm.c (CVE-2019-15221)\n* kernel: Two memory leaks in the mwifiex_pcie_init_evt_ring() function in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/pcie.c allows for a DoS (CVE-2019-19057)\n* kernel: Memory leaks in drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/htc_hst.c in the Linux kernel (DOS) (CVE-2019-19073)\n* kernel: a memory leak in the ath9k management function in allows local DoS (CVE-2019-19074)\n* kernel: when cpu.cfs_quota_us is used allows attackers to cause a denial of service against non-cpu-bound applications (CVE-2019-19922)\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\nAdditional Changes:\nThis update also fixes several bugs and adds various enhancements.
