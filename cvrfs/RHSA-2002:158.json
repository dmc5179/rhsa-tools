Many\npeople find this to be an easier way to apply updates. To use Red Hat\nNetwork, launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.

This kernel update also fixes a difficult to trigger race in\nthe dcache (filesystem cache) code, as well as some potential security\nholes, although we are not currently aware of any exploits.","The 2.4.18-5 kernel introduced some safety checks in the VM subsystem that\nwere triggered when exiting an X session while using 3D acceleration with\nthe Intel i810/i815 chipset. Additionally, there was a difficult to trigger\nrace in the dcache of the file system subsystem.\nThis kernel update addresses both of these issues.\nIn addition, there are fixes for potential security holes in the following\ndrivers:\nstradis\nrio500\nse401\nusbvideo\napm\nFinally, this kernel fixes a few files in the /proc file system which had\nthe capability to expose kernel memory when abused.\nAll of the security issues found during an audit and none of them,  at the\ntime of this writing, have any known exploits.\nWe would like to thank Silvio Cesare, Stas Sergeev, Andi Kleen, Solar\nDesigner, and others for their auditing work.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
