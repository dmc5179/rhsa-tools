The address parser performs insufficient bounds checking in certain\nconditions due to a char to int conversion, making it possible for an\nattacker to take control of the application.  Although no exploit currently\nexists, this issue is probably locally exploitable and may also be remotely\nexploitable.\nAll users are advised to update to these erratum packages containing a\nbackported patch which corrects these vulnerabilities.\nRed Hat would like to thank Michal Zalewski for finding and reporting this\nissue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
