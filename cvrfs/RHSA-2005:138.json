A local user\ncould use this flaw to load arbitrary shared libraries and therefore\nexecute arbitrary code, gaining the privileges of the PostgreSQL server.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2005-0227 to this issue.\nA permission checking flaw in PostgreSQL was discovered. A local user\ncould bypass the EXECUTE permission check for functions by using the CREATE\nAGGREGATE command. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0244 to this issue.\nMultiple buffer overflows were found in PL/PgSQL. A database user who has\npermissions to create plpgsql functions could trigger this flaw which could\nlead to arbitrary code execution, gaining the privileges of the PostgreSQL\nserver. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\nhas assigned the names CAN-2005-0245 and CAN-2005-0247 to these issues.\nA flaw in the integer aggregator (intagg) contrib module for PostgreSQL was\nfound. A user could create carefully crafted arrays and cause a denial of\nservice (crash). The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0246 to this issue.\nThe update also fixes some minor problems, notably conflicts with SELinux.\nUsers of postgresql should update to these erratum packages that contain\npatches and are not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
