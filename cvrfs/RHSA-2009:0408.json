The Generic\nSecurity Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) definition\nprovides security services to callers (protocols) in a generic fashion. The\nSimple and Protected GSS-API Negotiation (SPNEGO) mechanism is used by\nGSS-API peers to choose from a common set of security mechanisms.\nAn input validation flaw was found in the ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation\nOne) decoder used by MIT Kerberos. A remote attacker could use this flaw to\ncrash a network service using the MIT Kerberos library, such as kadmind or\nkrb5kdc, by causing it to dereference or free an uninitialized pointer.\n(CVE-2009-0846)\nMultiple input validation flaws were found in the MIT Kerberos GSS-API\nlibrary's implementation of the SPNEGO mechanism. A remote attacker could\nuse these flaws to crash any network service utilizing the MIT Kerberos\nGSS-API library to authenticate users or, possibly, leak portions of the\nservice's memory. (CVE-2009-0844, CVE-2009-0845)\nAll krb5 users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues. All running services using the\nMIT Kerberos libraries must be restarted for the update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
