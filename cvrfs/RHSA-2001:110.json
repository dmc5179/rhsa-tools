To \ncheck if you are affected by this issue, use the following command:\n/bin/ls /etc/rc.d/init.d/serial\nIf this gives the output '/etc/rc.d/init.d/serial' then the initscript \nhas been manually installed.

If this initscript is manually copied into the init.d \ndirectory structure and enabled, and the kernel is recompiled to have \nmodular serial port support, then the initscript will use a predictable \ntemporary file name.\nThere are a number of other bugs that also prevent the initscript from\nworking correctly in this situation (detailed in bugzilla bug #52862).","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
