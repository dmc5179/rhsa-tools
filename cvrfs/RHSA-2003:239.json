This causes the program to fail to change the\nownership and permissions of already opened entries.\nCAN-2003-0550: The STP protocol is known to have no security, which could\nallow attackers to alter the bridge topology. STP is now turned off by\ndefault.\nCAN-2003-0551: STP input processing was lax in its length checking, which\ncould lead to a denial of service (DoS).\nCAN-2003-0552: Jerry Kreuscher discovered that the Forwarding table could\nbe spoofed by sending forged packets with bogus source addresses the same\nas the local host.\nCAN-2003-0619: An integer signedness error in the decode_fh function of\nnfs3xdr.c allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (kernel\npanic) via a negative size value within XDR data of an NFSv3 procedure call.\nCAN-2003-0699: The C-Media PCI sound driver in Linux kernel versions prior\nto 2.4.21 accesses userspace without using the get_user function, which is\na potential security hole.\nAll users are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain\nbackported security patches correcting these vulnerabilities.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
