By exploiting\nthese issues it may be possible to make Ethereal crash by injecting an\nintentionally malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to\nread a malformed packet trace file.  It is not known if these issues could\nallow arbitrary code execution.\nThe SMB dissector in Ethereal before 0.10.0 allows remote attackers to\ncause a denial of service via a malformed SMB packet that triggers a\nsegmentation fault during processing of Selected packets. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-1012 to this issue.\nThe Q.931 dissector in Ethereal before 0.10.0 allows remote attackers to\ncause a denial of service (crash) via a malformed Q.931, which triggers a\nnull dereference. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-1013 to this issue.\nUsers of Ethereal should update to these erratum packages containing\nEthereal version 0.10.0, which is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
