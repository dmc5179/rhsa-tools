Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.","The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the sctp_rcv_ootb() function\nin the Linux kernel Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)\nimplementation. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted SCTP\npacket to a target system, resulting in a denial of service.\n(CVE-2010-0008, Important)\n* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel. During a\ncore dump, the kernel did not check if the Virtual Dynamically-linked\nShared Object page was accessible. On Intel 64 and AMD64 systems, a local,\nunprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a kernel panic by running a\ncrafted 32-bit application. (CVE-2009-4271, Important)\n* an information leak was found in the print_fatal_signal() implementation\nin the Linux kernel. When \"/proc/sys/kernel/print-fatal-signals\" is set to\n1 (the default value is 0), memory that is reachable by the kernel could be\nleaked to user-space. This issue could also result in a system crash. Note\nthat this flaw only affected the i386 architecture. (CVE-2010-0003,\nModerate)\n* on AMD64 systems, it was discovered that the kernel did not ensure the\nELF interpreter was available before making a call to the SET_PERSONALITY\nmacro. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service by\nrunning a 32-bit application that attempts to execute a 64-bit application.\n(CVE-2010-0307, Moderate)\n* missing capability checks were found in the ebtables implementation, used\nfor creating an Ethernet bridge firewall. This could allow a local,\nunprivileged user to bypass intended capability restrictions and modify\nebtables rules. (CVE-2010-0007, Low)\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n* under some circumstances, a locking bug could have caused an online ext3\nfile system resize to deadlock, which may have, in turn, caused the file\nsystem or the entire system to become unresponsive. In either case, a\nreboot was required after the deadlock. With this update, using resize2fs\nto perform an online resize of an ext3 file system works as expected.\n(BZ#553135)\n* some ATA and SCSI devices were not honoring the barrier=1 mount option,\nwhich could result in data loss after a crash or power loss. This update\napplies a patch to the Linux SCSI driver to ensure ordered write caching.\nThis solution does not provide cache flushes; however, it does provide\ndata integrity on devices that have no write caching (or where write\ncaching is disabled) and no command queuing. For systems that have command\nqueuing or write cache enabled there is no guarantee of data integrity\nafter a crash. (BZ#560563)\n* it was found that lpfc_find_target() could loop continuously when\nscanning a list of nodes due to a missing spinlock. This missing spinlock\nallowed the list to be changed after the list_empty() test, resulting in a\nNULL value, causing the loop. This update adds the spinlock, resolving the\nissue. (BZ#561453)\n* the fix for CVE-2009-4538 provided by RHSA-2010:0020 introduced a\nregression, preventing Wake on LAN (WoL) working for network devices using\nthe Intel PRO/1000 Linux driver, e1000e. Attempting to configure WoL for\nsuch devices resulted in the following error, even when configuring valid\noptions:\n\"Cannot set new wake-on-lan settings: Operation not supported\nnot setting wol\"\nThis update resolves this regression, and WoL now works as expected for\nnetwork devices using the e1000e driver. (BZ#565496)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
