Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.","JBoss Data Grid is a distributed in-memory data grid, based on Infinispan.\nThis release of JBoss Data Grid 6.1.0 serves as a replacement for JBoss\nData Grid 6.0.1. It includes various bug fixes and enhancements which are\ndetailed in the JBoss Data Grid 6.1.0 Release Notes. The Release Notes will\nbe available shortly from https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/\nThis update also fixes the following security issues:\nWhen using LDAP authentication with either the \"ldap\" configuration entry\nor the provided LDAP login modules (LdapLoginModule/LdapExtLoginModule),\nempty passwords were allowed by default. An attacker could use this flaw to\nbypass intended authentication by providing an empty password for a valid\nusername, as the LDAP server may recognize this as an 'unauthenticated\nauthentication' (RFC 4513). This update sets the allowEmptyPasswords option\nfor the LDAP login modules to false if the option is not already\nconfigured. (CVE-2012-5629)\nNote: If you are using the \"ldap\" configuration entry and rely on empty\npasswords, they will no longer work after applying this update. The\njboss-as-domain-management module, by default, will prevent empty\npasswords. This cannot be configured; however, a future release may add a\nconfiguration option to allow empty passwords when using the \"ldap\"\nconfiguration entry.\nIt was found that sending a request without a session identifier to a\nprotected resource could bypass the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\nprevention filter in JBoss Web. A remote attacker could use this flaw to\nperform CSRF attacks against applications that rely on the CSRF prevention\nfilter and do not contain internal mitigation for CSRF. (CVE-2012-4431)\nMultiple weaknesses were found in the JBoss Web DIGEST authentication\nimplementation, effectively reducing the security normally provided by\nDIGEST authentication. A remote attacker could use these flaws to perform\nreplay attacks in some circumstances. (CVE-2012-5885, CVE-2012-5886,\nCVE-2012-5887)\nWarning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss Data Grid\ninstallation.\nAll users of JBoss Data Grid 6.0.1 as provided from the Red Hat Customer\nPortal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Data Grid 6.1.0.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
