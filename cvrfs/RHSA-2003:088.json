The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0127 to this issue.\nMultiple ethernet Network Interface Card (NIC) device drivers do not pad\nframes with null bytes, which allows remote attackers to obtain information\nfrom previous packets or kernel memory by using malformed packets.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2003-0001 to this issue.\nThe Linux 2.2 kernel allows local users to cause a denial of service\n(crash) by using the mmap() function with a PROT_READ parameter to access\nnon-readable memory pages through the /proc/pid/mem interface.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2002-1380 to this issue.\nAll users of Red Hat Linux 6.2 and 7 should upgrade to these errata\npackages, which contain version 2.2.24 of the Linux kernel with patches and\nare not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
