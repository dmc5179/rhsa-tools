This could,\npotentially, lead to a remote denial of service or arbitrary code execution\nif a Forward-TSN chunk is received with a large stream ID. Note: An\nestablished connection between SCTP endpoints is necessary to exploit this\nvulnerability. Refer to the Knowledgebase article in the References section\nfor further information. (CVE-2009-0065, Important)\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n* a problem in the way the i5000_edac module reported errors may have\ncaused the console on some systems to be flooded with errors, similar to\nthe following:\nEDAC i5000 MC0: NON-FATAL ERROR Found!!! 1st NON-FATAL Err Reg= [hex value]\nEDAC i5000: NON-Retry Errors, bits= [hex value]\nAfter installing this update, the console will not be flooded with these\nerrors. (BZ#494734)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
