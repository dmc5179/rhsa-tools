This could\nallow an attacker to perform a cross-site scripting attack if a victim was\ntricked into connecting to a site and sending a carefully crafted Expect\nheader. (CVE-2006-3918)\nWhile a web browser cannot be forced to send an arbitrary Expect header by\na third-party attacker, it was recently discovered that certain versions of\nthe Flash plugin can manipulate request headers. If users running such\nversions can be persuaded to load a web page with a malicious Flash applet,\na cross-site scripting attack against the server may be possible.\nA flaw in mod_imap when using the Referer directive with image maps was\ndiscovered. With certain site configurations, a remote attacker could\nperform a cross-site scripting attack if a victim can be forced to visit a\nmalicious URL using certain web browsers.  (CVE-2005-3352)\nUsers of Stronghold should upgrade to these updated packages, which \ncontain a backported patch to correct this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
