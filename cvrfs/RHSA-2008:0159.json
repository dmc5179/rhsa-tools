It is used\nboth for the system-wide message bus service, and as a\nper-user-login-session messaging facility.\nHavoc Pennington discovered a flaw in the way the dbus-daemon applies its\nsecurity policy. A user with the ability to connect to the dbus-daemon may\nbe able to execute certain method calls they should normally not have\npermission to access.  (CVE-2008-0595)\nRed Hat does not ship any applications in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 that\nwould allow a user to leverage this flaw to elevate their privileges.\nThis flaw does not affect the version of D-Bus shipped in Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 4.\nAll users are advised to upgrade to these updated dbus packages, which\ncontain a backported patch and are not vulnerable to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
