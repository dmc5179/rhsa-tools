If a user is tricked\ninto processing a specially crafted executable file, it may allow the\nexecution of arbitrary code as the user running gdb. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2005-1704 to this issue.\nA bug was found in the way gdb loads .gdbinit files. When a user executes\ngdb, the local directory is searched for a .gdbinit file which is then\nloaded. It is possible for a local user to execute arbitrary commands as\nthe victim running gdb by placing a malicious .gdbinit file in a location\nwhere gdb may be run. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-1705 to this issue.\nThis updated package also addresses the following issues:\n- GDB on ia64 had previously implemented a bug fix to work-around a kernel\nproblem when creating a core file via gcore.  The bug fix caused a\nsignificant slow-down of gcore.\n- GDB on ia64 issued an extraneous warning when gcore was used.\n- GDB on ia64 could not backtrace over a sigaltstack.\n- GDB on ia64 could not successfully do an info frame for a signal trampoline.\n- GDB on AMD64 and Intel EM64T had problems attaching to a 32-bit process.\n- GDB on AMD64 and Intel EM64T was not properly handling threaded watchpoints.\n- GDB could not build with gcc4 when -Werror flag was set.\n- GDB had problems printing inherited members of C++ classes.\n- A few updates from mainline sources concerning Dwarf2 partial die in\ncache support, follow-fork support, interrupted syscall support, and\nDW_OP_piece read support.\nAll users of gdb should upgrade to this updated package, which resolves\nthese issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
