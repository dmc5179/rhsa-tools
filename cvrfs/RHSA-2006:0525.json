It takes a multi-server\nand multi-thread approach to resolve the current complexity of the Internet.\nAn information disclosure flaw was found in the way Quagga interprets RIP\nREQUEST packets. RIPd in Quagga will respond to RIP REQUEST packets for RIP\nversions that have been disabled or that have authentication enabled,\nallowing a remote attacker to acquire information about the local network.\n(CVE-2006-2223)\nA route injection flaw was found in the way Quagga interprets RIPv1\nRESPONSE packets when RIPv2 authentication is enabled. It is possible for a\nremote attacker to inject arbitrary route information into the RIPd routing\ntables. This issue does not affect Quagga configurations where only RIPv2\nis specified. (CVE-2006-2224)\nA denial of service flaw was found in Quagga's telnet interface. If an\nattacker is able to connect to the Quagga telnet interface, it is possible\nto cause Quagga to consume vast quantities of CPU resources by issuing a\nmalformed 'sh' command. (CVE-2006-2276)\nUsers of Quagga should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches that correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
