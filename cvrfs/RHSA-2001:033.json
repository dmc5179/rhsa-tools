These\npackages reduce the amount of information a passive attacker can deduce\nfrom observing an encrypted session.","Weaknesses in the SSH protocols can be used by a passive attacker to deduce\ninformation about passwords entered over an encrypted connection.  This\ninformation can be used to reduce the number of possible solutions which\nneed to be tested to perform a brute-force attack. This reduces the amount\nof time and resources required to mount such an attack successfully.\nOpenSSH 2.5.1 and 2.5.2 include modifications which, while not completely\nresolving this problem, reduce the risks by changing certain server\nbehaviors to make passive analysis more difficult.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
