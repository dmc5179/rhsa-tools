(CVE-2008-1377)\nMultiple integer overflow flaws were found in X.org's Render extension. A\nmalicious authorized client could exploit these issues to cause a denial of\nservice (crash) or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with root\nprivileges on the X.Org server. (CVE-2008-2360, CVE-2008-2361,\nCVE-2008-2362)\nAn input validation flaw was discovered in X.org's MIT-SHM extension.
