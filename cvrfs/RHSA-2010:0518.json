A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\nbase score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the\nCVE link in the References section.","The scsi-target-utils package contains the daemon and tools to set up and\nmonitor SCSI targets. Currently, iSCSI software and iSER targets are\nsupported.\nMultiple buffer overflow flaws were found in scsi-target-utils' tgtd\ndaemon. A remote attacker could trigger these flaws by sending a\ncarefully-crafted Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) request, causing the\ntgtd daemon to crash. (CVE-2010-2221)\nRed Hat would like to thank the Vulnerability Research Team at TELUS\nSecurity Labs and Fujita Tomonori for responsibly reporting these flaws.\nAll scsi-target-utils users should upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains a backported patch to correct these issues. All running\nscsi-target-utils services must be restarted for the update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
