This is the sixth regular update.","The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating\nsystem.\nThis is the sixth regular kernel update to Red Hat Enterprise Linux version\n2.1. It updates a number of device drivers, and adds much improved SATA\nsupport.\nThis update includes fixes for several security issues:\nPaul Starzetz of iSEC discovered various flaws in the ELF binary\nloader affecting kernels prior to 2.4.28. A local user could use these\nflaws to gain read access to executable-only binaries or possibly gain\nprivileges. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CAN-2004-1070, CAN-2004-1071,\nCAN-2004-1072, and CAN-2004-1073 to these issues.\nA missing serialization flaw in unix_dgram_recvmsg was discovered that\naffects kernels prior to 2.4.28. A local user could potentially make\nuse of a race condition in order to gain privileges. (CAN-2004-1068)\nStefan Esser discovered various flaws including buffer overflows in\nthe smbfs driver affecting kernels before 2.4.28. A local user may be\nable to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly gain privileges.\nIn order to exploit these flaws the user would need to have control of\na connected smb server. (CAN-2004-0883, CAN-2004-0949)\nConectiva discovered flaws in certain USB drivers affecting kernels\nbefore 2.4.27 which used the copy_to_user function on uninitialized\nstructures. These flaws could allow local users to read small\namounts of kernel memory. (CAN-2004-0685)\nThe ext3 code in kernels before 2.4.26 did not properly initialize journal\ndescriptor blocks. A privileged local user could read portions of kernel\nmemory. (CAN-2004-0177)\nThe following drivers have also been updated:\n* tg3 v3.10\n* e1000 v5.3.19-k2\n* e100 v3.0.27-k2\n* megaraid \n* megaraid2 v2.10.8.2\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 users are advised to upgrade their kernels\nto the packages associated with their machine architectures and\nconfigurations as listed in this erratum.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
