DHCP is a protocol that allows\ndevices to get their own network configuration information from a server.\nA bug was found in the way dhcpd validates certain DHCP protocol options. \nA malicious DHCP client could send a carefully crafted DHCP request and cause\ndhcpd to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2007-5365)\nAll users of dhcp should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a\nbackported patch that resolves this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
