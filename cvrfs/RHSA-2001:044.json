By exploiting these vulnerabilities,\nlocal users could overwrite any file in the system.\nIt is recommended that all samba users upgrade to the fixed packages.\nPlease note that the packages for Red Hat Linux 6.2 require an updated\nlogrotate package.\nNote: these packages include the security patch from Samba-2.0.9.","The printing code in smbd uses predictable filenames in /tmp, and passes\nthem as an output file to system();  a user could create a symbolic\nlink in /tmp and then overwrite any file on the system; later on chmod(0666)\nis called on the file, leading to even more problems.\nThe smbclient 'more' and 'mput' commands also used /tmp files insecurely;\nthis is less of a risk in that these are not normally run as root.\nThanks go to Marcus Meissner (mm@caldera.de) for investigating the issue\nand to the Samba team for providing a patch.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
