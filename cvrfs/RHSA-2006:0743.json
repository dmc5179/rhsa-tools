A remote attacker who is able to access the\nconsole manager could read or write to files with the permissions of the\nJBoss user. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution as the\njboss user. (CVE-2006-5750)\nFor the Red Hat Application Stack, the jbossas service is not enabled by\ndefault. Once the jbossas service is enabled, the console manager will\nbecome accessible on port 8080. Although port 8080 will be blocked from\noutside access by the default Red Hat Enterprise Linux firewall rules,\nusers should ensure that the console is not available publicly and is\nadequately protected by authentication as explained in the JBoss\ndocumentation. A correct configuration of the JBoss Application Server\nwould mitigate this vulnerability to only being exploitable by users who\nhave authorization to use the console manager.\nAll users of Red Hat Application Stack are advised to upgrade to these\nupdated packages, which resolve the directory traversal issue with a\nbackported patch.\nThese updated packages also contain a change to the default jbossas\nconfiguration file.  For users installing Red Hat Application Stack for the\nfirst time, all JBoss Application Server network services, including the\nmanagement consoles, will be restricted by default to localhost.  No change\nis made for users upgrading previously installed jbossas packages.  \nUsers who already have Red Hat Application Stack installed should check to\nmake sure that they have correctly followed the security guidelines and\nthat the management consoles are not accessible to unauthorized users.  \nRed Hat would like to thank Symantec for reporting this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
