Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based language to describe\nvector images. KSVG is a framework aimed at implementing the latest W3C SVG\nspecifications.\nA use-after-free flaw was found in the KDE KSVG animation element\nimplementation. A remote attacker could create a specially-crafted SVG\nimage, which once opened by an unsuspecting user, could cause a denial of\nservice (Konqueror crash) or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user running Konqueror. (CVE-2009-1709)\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the KDE, KSVG SVGList\ninterface implementation. A remote attacker could create a\nspecially-crafted SVG image, which once opened by an unsuspecting user,\nwould cause memory corruption, leading to a denial of service (Konqueror\ncrash). (CVE-2009-0945)\nAll users of kdegraphics should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. The desktop must be\nrestarted (log out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
