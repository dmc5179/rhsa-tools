Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.","These packages provide the OpenJDK 6 Java Runtime Environment and the\nOpenJDK 6 Software Development Kit.\ndefaultReadObject of the Serialization API could be tricked into setting a\nvolatile field multiple times, which could allow a remote attacker to\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the applet\nor application. (CVE-2010-3569)\nRace condition in the way objects were deserialized could allow an\nuntrusted applet or application to misuse the privileges of the user\nrunning the applet or application. (CVE-2010-3568)\nMiscalculation in the OpenType font rendering implementation caused\nout-of-bounds memory access, which could allow remote attackers to execute\ncode with the privileges of the user running the java process.\n(CVE-2010-3567)\nJPEGImageWriter.writeImage in the imageio API improperly checked certain\nimage metadata, which could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary\ncode in the context of the user running the applet or application.\n(CVE-2010-3565)\nDouble free in IndexColorModel could cause an untrusted applet or\napplication to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user running the applet or application. (CVE-2010-3562)\nThe privileged accept method of the ServerSocket class in the Common Object\nRequest Broker Architecture (CORBA) implementation in OpenJDK allowed it to\nreceive connections from any host, instead of just the host of the current\nconnection. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass restrictions defined\nby network permissions. (CVE-2010-3561)\nFlaws in the Swing library could allow an untrusted application to modify\nthe behavior and state of certain JDK classes. (CVE-2010-3557)\nFlaws in the CORBA implementation could allow an attacker to execute\narbitrary code by misusing permissions granted to certain system objects.\n(CVE-2010-3554)\nUIDefault.ProxyLazyValue had unsafe reflection usage, allowing untrusted\ncallers to create objects via ProxyLazyValue values. (CVE-2010-3553)\nHttpURLConnection improperly handled the \"chunked\" transfer encoding\nmethod, which could allow remote attackers to conduct HTTP response\nsplitting attacks. (CVE-2010-3549)\nHttpURLConnection improperly checked whether the calling code was granted\nthe \"allowHttpTrace\" permission, allowing untrusted code to create HTTP\nTRACE requests. (CVE-2010-3574)\nHttpURLConnection did not validate request headers set by applets, which\ncould allow remote attackers to trigger actions otherwise restricted to\nHTTP clients. (CVE-2010-3541, CVE-2010-3573)\nThe Kerberos implementation improperly checked the sanity of AP-REQ\nrequests, which could cause a denial of service condition in the receiving\nJava Virtual Machine. (CVE-2010-3564)\nThe RHSA-2010:0339 update mitigated a man-in-the-middle attack in the way\nthe TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer) protocols\nhandle session renegotiation by disabling renegotiation. This update\nimplements the TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension as defined in RFC\n5746, allowing secure renegotiation between updated clients and servers.\n(CVE-2009-3555)\nThe NetworkInterface class improperly checked the network \"connect\"\npermissions for local network addresses, which could allow remote attackers\nto read local network addresses. (CVE-2010-3551)\nInformation leak flaw in the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI)\ncould allow a remote attacker to access information about\notherwise-protected internal network names. (CVE-2010-3548)\nNote: Flaws concerning applets in this advisory (CVE-2010-3568,\nCVE-2010-3554, CVE-2009-3555, CVE-2010-3562, CVE-2010-3557, CVE-2010-3548,\nCVE-2010-3564, CVE-2010-3565, CVE-2010-3569) can only be triggered in\nOpenJDK by calling the \"appletviewer\" application.\nBug fixes:\n* This update provides one defense in depth patch. (BZ#639922)\n* Problems for certain SSL connections. In a reported case, this prevented\nthe JBoss JAAS modules from connecting over SSL to Microsoft Active\nDirectory servers.
