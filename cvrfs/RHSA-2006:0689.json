(CVE-2006-4535, Important)\n* a flaw in the hugepage table support that allowed a local user to cause a\ndenial of service (crash). (CVE-2005-4811, Important)\n* a flaw in the mprotect system call that allowed setting write permission\nfor a read-only attachment of shared memory. (CVE-2006-2071, Moderate)\n* a flaw in HID0[31] (en_attn) register handling on PowerPC 970 systems\nthat allowed a local user to cause a denial of service. (crash)\n(CVE-2006-4093, Moderate)\n* a flaw in the perfmon support of Itanium systems that allowed a local\nuser to cause a denial of service by consuming all file descriptors.\n(CVE-2006-3741, Moderate)\n* a flaw in the ATM subsystem. On systems with installed ATM hardware and\nconfigured ATM support, a remote user could cause a denial of service\n(panic) by accessing socket buffers memory after freeing them.\n(CVE-2006-4997, Moderate)\n* a flaw in the DVB subsystem. On systems with installed DVB hardware and\nconfigured DVB support, a remote user could cause a denial of service\n(panic) by sending a ULE SNDU packet with length of 0. (CVE-2006-4623, Low)\n* an information leak in the network subsystem that possibly allowed a\nlocal user to read sensitive data from kernel memory. (CVE-2006-0039, Low)\nIn addition, two bugfixes for the IPW-2200 wireless driver were included.\nThe first one ensures that wireless management applications correctly\nidentify IPW-2200 controlled devices, while the second fix ensures that\nDHCP requests using the IPW-2200 operate correctly.\nRed Hat would like to thank Olof Johansson, Stephane Eranian and Solar\nDesigner for reporting issues fixed in this erratum.\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users are advised to upgrade their kernels\nto the packages associated with their machine architectures and\nconfigurations as listed in this erratum.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
