SoX can convert\nbetween many different digitized sound formats and perform simple sound\nmanipulation functions, including sound effects.\nBuffer overflows existed in the parsing of WAV file header fields. It was\npossible that a malicious WAV file could have caused arbitrary code to be\nexecuted when the file was played or converted.  The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0557\nto these issues.\nAll users of sox should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve\nthese issues as well as fix a number of minor bugs.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
