A\nweb page containing specially-crafted content could potentially trick a\nFirefox user into surrendering sensitive information. (CVE-2008-2800)\nTwo local file disclosure flaws were found in Firefox. A web page\ncontaining malicious content could cause Firefox to reveal the contents of\na local file to a remote attacker. (CVE-2008-2805, CVE-2008-2810)\nA flaw was found in the way a malformed .properties file was processed by\nFirefox. A malicious extension could read uninitialized memory, possibly\nleaking sensitive data to the extension.

(CVE-2008-2808)\nA flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed information about self-signed\ncertificates. It was possible for a self-signed certificate to contain\nmultiple alternate name entries, which were not all displayed to the user,\nallowing them to mistakenly extend trust to an unknown site.\n(CVE-2008-2809)\nAll Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches that correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
