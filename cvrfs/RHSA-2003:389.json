Note that you need to select the\nkernel explicitly if you are using the default configuration of up2date.\nTo install kernel packages manually, use \"rpm -ivh <package>\" and\nmodify system settings to boot the kernel you have installed.  To\ndo this, edit /boot/grub/grub.conf and change the default entry to\n\"default=0\" (or, if you have chosen to use LILO as your boot loader,\nedit /etc/lilo.conf and run lilo)\nDo not use \"rpm -Uvh\" as that will remove your running kernel binaries\nfrom your system.  You may use \"rpm -e\" to remove old kernels after\ndetermining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003:389"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Important","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated kernel packages are now available that fix a security\nvulnerability allowing local users to gain root privileges.","The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.\nA flaw in bounds checking in the do_brk() function in the Linux kernel\nversions 2.4.22 and previous can allow a local attacker to gain root\nprivileges.
