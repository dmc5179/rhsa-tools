Console users with access to certain device files had the ability\nto damage recordable CD drives. The way pam_console handled permissions of\nthese files has been modified to disallow access. This change also required\nmodifications to the cdrecord application. (CVE-2004-0813)\nA flaw was found in the way pam_console set console device permissions. It\nwas possible for various console devices to retain ownership of the console\nuser after logging out, possibly leaking information to an unauthorized\nuser. (CVE-2007-1716)\nThe pam_unix module provides authentication against standard /etc/passwd\nand /etc/shadow files. The pam_stack module provides support for stacking\nPAM configuration files. Both of these modules contained small memory leaks\nwhich caused problems in applications calling PAM authentication repeatedly\nin the same process.\nAll users of PAM should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve\nthese issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
