Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.

In the 2.4 kernel, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux, the only way this could happen is through the kernel nfs server. A\nuser on a system that mounted a remote file system from a vulnerable\nmachine may be able to make unauthorized changes to the group ID of\nexported files. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0497 to this issue.\nOnly Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems that are configured to share\nfile systems via NFS are affected by this issue.\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 users are advised to upgrade their\nkernels to the packages associated with their machine architectures\nand configurations as listed in this erratum.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
