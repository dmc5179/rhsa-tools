On sites where mod_imagemap\nwas enabled and an imagemap file was publicly available, a cross-site\nscripting attack was possible. (CVE-2007-5000)\nA flaw was found in the mod_autoindex module. On sites where directory\nlistings are used, and the \"AddDefaultCharset\" directive has been removed\nfrom the configuration, a cross-site scripting attack might have been\npossible against Web browsers which do not correctly derive the response\ncharacter set following the rules in RFC 2616. (CVE-2007-4465)\nA flaw was found in the mod_status module. On sites where mod_status was\nenabled and the status pages were publicly available, a cross-site\nscripting attack was possible. (CVE-2007-6388)\nA flaw was found in the mod_proxy_balancer module. On sites where\nmod_proxy_balancer was enabled, a cross-site scripting attack against an\nauthorized user was possible. (CVE-2007-6421)\nA flaw was found in the mod_proxy_balancer module. On sites where\nmod_proxy_balancer was enabled, an authorized user could send a carefully\ncrafted request that would cause the Apache child process handling that\nrequest to crash. This could lead to a denial of service if using a\nthreaded Multi-Processing Module. (CVE-2007-6422) \nA flaw was found in the mod_proxy_ftp module. On sites where mod_proxy_ftp\nwas enabled and a forward proxy was configured, a cross-site scripting\nattack was possible against Web browsers which do not correctly derive the\nresponse character set following the rules in RFC 2616. (CVE-2008-0005)\nUsers of Apache httpd should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve these issues. Users should restart\nhttpd after installing this update.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
