Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2002:018"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["New rsync packages are available; these fix a remotely exploitable problem\nin the I/O functions. These include the security patch from the recently\nreleased rsync-2.5.2. It is strongly recommended that all users of rsync\nupgrade to the fixed\npackages.\n2002-01-28: There was an error in the original bugfix patch for the\nsecurity problem - the new rsync could fail under some circumstances. This\nhas been fixed in a new build.","rsync is a powerful tool used for mirroring directory structures across\nmachines.  rsync has been found to contain several signed/unsigned bugs in\nits I/O functions which are remotely exploitable.   A remote user can crash\nthe rsync server/client and execute code as the user running the rsync\nserver or client.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0048 to this issue.\nAll users of rsync should upgrade their packages.  In addition rsync server\nadministrators should consider using the \"use chroot\", \"uid\",  and \"read\nonly\" options, which can significantly reduce the impact of a security\nproblem in rsync or elsewhere.\nThanks go to Sebastian Krahmer for providing a patch for this vulnerability\nand to Andrew Tridgell and Martin Pool for their rapid response.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
