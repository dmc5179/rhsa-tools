The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0081 to this issue.\nTesting performed by Novell using a test suite provided by NISCC uncovered\nan issue in the ASN.1 parser in versions of OpenSSL 0.9.6 prior to 0.9.6l\nwhich could cause large recursion and possibly lead to a denial of service\nattack if used where stack space is limited.  The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0851\nto this issue.\nThese updated packages contain patches provided by the OpenSSL group that\nprotect against these issues.\nNOTE: Because server applications are affected by this issue, users are\nadvised to either restart all services using OpenSSL functionality or\nrestart their system after installing these updated packages.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
