Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.\n[Updated 21st July 2010]\nBZ#557684 documentation expanded.","The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\nSecurity fixes:\n* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the sctp_rcv_ootb() function\nin the Linux kernel Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)\nimplementation. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted SCTP\npacket to a target system, resulting in a denial of service.\n(CVE-2010-0008, Important)\n* a missing boundary check was found in the do_move_pages() function in the\nmemory migration functionality in the Linux kernel. A local user could use\nthis flaw to cause a local denial of service or an information leak.\n(CVE-2010-0415, Important)\n* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the ip6_dst_lookup_tail()\nfunction in the Linux kernel. An attacker on the local network could\ntrigger this flaw by sending IPv6 traffic to a target system, leading to a\nsystem crash (kernel OOPS) if dst->neighbour is NULL on the target system\nwhen receiving an IPv6 packet. (CVE-2010-0437, Important)\n* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the ext4 file system code in\nthe Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this flaw to trigger a local\ndenial of service by mounting a specially-crafted, journal-less ext4 file\nsystem, if that file system forced an EROFS error. (CVE-2009-4308,\nModerate)\n* an information leak was found in the print_fatal_signal() implementation\nin the Linux kernel. When \"/proc/sys/kernel/print-fatal-signals\" is set to\n1 (the default value is 0), memory that is reachable by the kernel could be\nleaked to user-space. This issue could also result in a system crash. Note\nthat this flaw only affected the i386 architecture. (CVE-2010-0003,\nModerate)\n* missing capability checks were found in the ebtables implementation, used\nfor creating an Ethernet bridge firewall. This could allow a local,\nunprivileged user to bypass intended capability restrictions and modify\nebtables rules. (CVE-2010-0007, Low)\nBug fixes:\n* a bug prevented Wake on LAN (WoL) being enabled on certain Intel\nhardware. (BZ#543449)\n* a race issue in the Journaling Block Device. (BZ#553132)\n* 32-bit x86 timespec structures are not the same size as on 64-bit\nsystems. A 32-bit compatible function -- sys32_sched_rr_get_interval() --\nis available. However, when 32-bit programs running on 64-bit systems\ncalled sched_rr_get_interval(), it was not called and the kernel wrote data\npast the allocated space, causing user stack corruption.\nsys32_sched_rr_get_interval() is now called as expected. (BZ#557684)\n* the RHSA-2010:0019 update introduced a regression, preventing WoL from\nworking for network devices using the e1000e driver. (BZ#559335)\n* adding a bonding interface in mode balance-alb to a bridge was not\nfunctional. (BZ#560588)\n* some KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) guests experienced slow\nperformance (and possibly a crash) after suspend/resume. (BZ#560640)\n* on some systems, VF cannot be enabled in dom0. (BZ#560665)\n* on systems with certain network cards, a system crash occurred after\nenabling GRO. (BZ#561417)\n* for x86 KVM guests with pvclock enabled, the boot clocks were registered\ntwice, possibly causing KVM to write data to a random memory area during\nthe guest's life. (BZ#561454)\n* serious performance degradation for 32-bit applications, that map (mmap)\nthousands of small files, when run on a 64-bit system. (BZ#562746)\n* improved kexec/kdump handling. Previously, on some systems under heavy\nload, kexec/kdump was not functional. (BZ#562772)\n* dom0 was unable to boot when using the Xen hypervisor on a system with a\nlarge number of logical CPUs. (BZ#562777)\n* a fix for a bug that could potentially cause file system corruption.\n(BZ#564281)\n* a bug caused infrequent cluster issues for users of GFS2. (BZ#564288)\n* gfs2_delete_inode failed on read-only file systems. (BZ#564290)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
