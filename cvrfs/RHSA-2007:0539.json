A packaging flaw in the Red Hat AIDE rpm resulted in the file\ndatabase not containing any file checksum information. This could prevent\nAIDE from detecting certain file modifications. (CVE-2007-3849)\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n* certain configurations could result in a segmentation fault upon\ninitialization.\n* AIDE was unable to open its log file in the LSPP evaluated configuration.\n* if AIDE found SELinux context differences, the changed files report it\ngenerated only included the first 32 characters of the context.\nAll users of AIDE are advised to upgrade to this updated package containing\nAIDE version 0.13.1 which is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
