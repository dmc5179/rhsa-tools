This is the sixth\nregular update.\nThis security advisory has been rated as having important security impact\nby the Red Hat Security Response Team.","The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.\nThis is the sixth regular kernel update to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.\nNew features introduced by this update include:\n- diskdump support on HP Smart Array devices\n- netconsole/netdump support over bonded interfaces\n- new chipset and device support via PCI table updates\n- support for new \"oom-kill\" and \"kscand_work_percent\" sysctls\n- support for dual core processors and ACPI Power Management timers on\nAMD64 and Intel EM64T systems\nThere were many bug fixes in various parts of the kernel.  The ongoing\neffort to resolve these problems has resulted in a marked improvement in\nthe reliability and scalability of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.\nThere were numerous driver updates and security fixes (elaborated below).\nOther key areas affected by fixes in this update include kswapd, inode\nhandling, the SATA subsystem, diskdump handling, ptrace() syscall support,\nand signal handling.\nThe following device drivers have been upgraded to new versions:\n3w-9xxx ---- 2.24.03.008RH\ncciss ------ 2.4.58.RH1\ne100 ------- 3.4.8-k2\ne1000 ------ 6.0.54-k2\nemulex ----- 7.3.2\nfusion ----- 2.06.16i.01\niscsi ------ 3.6.2.1\nipmi ------- 35.4\nlpfcdfc ---- 1.2.1\nqlogic ----- 7.05.00-RH1\ntg3 -------- 3.27RH\nThe following security bugs were fixed in this update:\n- a flaw in syscall argument checking on Itanium systems that allowed\na local user to cause a denial of service (crash)  (CAN-2005-0136)\n- a flaw in stack expansion that allowed a local user of mlockall()\nto cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion)  (CAN-2005-0179)\n- a small memory leak in network packet defragmenting that allowed a\nremote user to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion) on\nsystems using netfilter  (CAN-2005-0210)\n- flaws in ptrace() syscall handling on AMD64 and Intel EM64T systems\nthat allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (crash)\n(CAN-2005-0756, CAN-2005-1762, CAN-2005-2553)\n- flaws in ISO-9660 file system handling that allowed the mounting of\nan invalid image on a CD-ROM to cause a denial of service (crash)\nor potentially execute arbitrary code  (CAN-2005-0815)\n- a flaw in ptrace() syscall handling on Itanium systems that allowed\na local user to cause a denial of service (crash)  (CAN-2005-1761)\n- a flaw in the alternate stack switching on AMD64 and Intel EM64T\nsystems that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service\n(crash)  (CAN-2005-1767)\n- race conditions in the ia32-compat support for exec() syscalls on\nAMD64, Intel EM64T, and Itanium systems that could allow a local\nuser to cause a denial of service (crash)  (CAN-2005-1768)\n- flaws in IPSEC network handling that allowed a local user to cause\na denial of service or potentially gain privileges  (CAN-2005-2456,\nCAN-2005-2555)\n- a flaw in sendmsg() syscall handling on 64-bit systems that allowed\na local user to cause a denial of service or potentially gain\nprivileges  (CAN-2005-2490)\n- flaws in unsupported modules that allowed denial-of-service attacks\n(crashes) or local privilege escalations on systems using the drm,\ncoda, or moxa modules  (CAN-2004-1056, CAN-2005-0124, CAN-2005-0504)\n- potential leaks of kernel data from jfs and ext2 file system handling\n(CAN-2004-0181, CAN-2005-0400)\nNote: The kernel-unsupported package contains various drivers and modules\nthat are unsupported and therefore might contain security problems that\nhave not been addressed.\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 users are advised to upgrade their\nkernels to the packages associated with their machine architectures\nand configurations as listed in this erratum.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
