The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name CAN-2005-1263\nto this issue. \nA flaw when freeing a pointer in load_elf_library was discovered.  A local\nuser could potentially use this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash).\n(CAN-2005-0749)\nThe Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) driver did not properly check the DMA\nlock, which could allow remote attackers or local users to cause a denial\nof service (X Server crash) or possibly modify the video output.\n(CAN-2004-1056)\nA flaw in the moxa serial driver could allow a local user to perform\nprivileged operations such as replacing the firmware. (CAN-2005-0504)\nThe following bug fixes were also made:\n- Fix a race condition that can cause a panic in __get_lease()\n- Fix a race condition that can cause a panic when reading /proc/mdstat\n- Fix incorrect ide accounting\n- Prevent non-root users from reloading moxa driver firmware\n- Fix a null-pointer-dereference bug in rpciod\n- Fix legacy-usb handoff for certain IBM platforms\n- Fix a bug that caused busy inodes after unmount\n- Provide an additional fix for a memory leak in scsi_scan_single.\n- Fix a potential kswapd/dquot deadlock.\n- Fix a potential local DoS in shmemfs.\n- Fix a random poolsize vulnerability.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 users are advised to upgrade their kernels to\nthe packages associated with their machine configurations as listed in this\nerratum.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
