CIFS clients convert Unicode strings sent by a\nserver to their local character sets, and then write those strings into\nmemory. If a malicious server sent a long enough string, it could write\npast the end of the target memory region and corrupt other memory areas,\npossibly leading to a denial of service or privilege escalation on the\nclient mounting the CIFS share. (CVE-2009-1439, CVE-2009-1633, Important)\n* the Linux kernel Network File System daemon (nfsd) implementation did not\ndrop the CAP_MKNOD capability when handling requests from local,\nunprivileged users. This flaw could possibly lead to an information leak or\nprivilege escalation. (CVE-2009-1072, Moderate)\n* Frank Filz reported the NFSv4 client was missing a file permission check\nfor the execute bit in some situations. This could allow local,\nunprivileged users to run non-executable files on NFSv4 mounted file\nsystems. (CVE-2009-1630, Moderate)\n* a missing check was found in the hypervisor_callback() function in the\nLinux kernel provided by the kernel-xen package. This could cause a denial\nof service of a 32-bit guest if an application running in that guest\naccesses a certain memory location in the kernel. (CVE-2009-1758, Moderate)\n* a flaw was found in the AGPGART driver. The agp_generic_alloc_page() and\nagp_generic_alloc_pages() functions did not zero out the memory pages they\nallocate, which may later be available to user-space processes. This flaw\ncould possibly lead to an information leak. (CVE-2009-1192, Low)\nBug fixes:\n* a race in the NFS client between destroying cached access rights and\nunmounting an NFS file system could have caused a system crash. \"Busy\ninodes\" messages may have been logged. (BZ#498653)\n* nanosleep() could sleep several milliseconds less than the specified time\non Intel ItaniumÂ®-based systems. (BZ#500349)\n* LEDs for disk drives in AHCI mode may have displayed a fault state when\nthere were no faults. (BZ#500120)\n* ptrace_do_wait() reported tasks were stopped each time the process doing\nthe trace called wait(), instead of reporting it once. (BZ#486945)\n* epoll_wait() may have caused a system lockup and problems for\napplications. (BZ#497322)\n* missing capabilities could possibly allow users with an fsuid other than\n0 to perform actions on some file system types that would otherwise be\nprevented. (BZ#497271)\n* on NFS mounted file systems, heavy write loads may have blocked\nnfs_getattr() for long periods, causing commands that use stat(2), such as\nls, to hang. (BZ#486926)\n* in rare circumstances, if an application performed multiple O_DIRECT\nreads per virtual memory page and also performed fork(2), the buffer\nstoring the result of the I/O may have ended up with invalid data.\n(BZ#486921)\n* when using GFS2, gfs2_quotad may have entered an uninterpretable sleep\nstate. (BZ#501742)\n* with this update, get_random_int() is more random and no longer uses a\ncommon seed value, reducing the possibility of predicting the values\nreturned. (BZ#499783)\n* the \"-fwrapv\" flag was added to the gcc build options to prevent gcc from\noptimizing away wrapping. (BZ#501751)\n* a kernel panic when enabling and disabling iSCSI paths. (BZ#502916)\n* using the Broadcom NetXtreme BCM5704 network device with the tg3 driver\ncaused high system load and very bad performance. (BZ#502837)\n* \"/proc/[pid]/maps\" and \"/proc/[pid]/smaps\" can only be read by processes\nable to use the ptrace() call on a given process; however, certain\ninformation from \"/proc/[pid]/stat\" and \"/proc/[pid]/wchan\" could be used\nto reconstruct memory maps. (BZ#499546)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
