These packages correct a bug in pam_xauth's handling of authorization\ndata for the root user.\n[Updated 16 April 2003]\nAdded packages for Red Hat Linux on IBM iSeries and pSeries systems.","The pam_xauth module is used to forward xauth information from user to user\nin applications such as 'su'.\nAndreas Beck discovered that versions of pam_xauth supplied with Red Hat\nLinux since version 7.1 would forward authorization information from the\nroot account to unprivileged users. This could be used by a local attacker\nto gain access to an administrator's X session. In order to exploit this\nvulnerability, the attacker would have to get the administrator, as root,\nto use su to the account belonging to the attacker.\nUsers of pam_xauth are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which\ncontain a patch that adds ACL (access control list) functionality to\npam_xauth and disallows root forwarding by default.\nVersions of pam_xauth included in Red Hat Linux 7 and earlier disabled\npassing of credentials from the root account to unprivileged users by\ndefault and are not affected by this issue.\nThanks to Andreas Beck for reporting this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
