Under normal circumstances, it is not\npossible for a local non-root user to verify the password of another local\nuser with the unix_chkpwd command. A patch applied that adds SELinux\nfunctionality makes it possible for a local user to use brute force\npassword guessing techniques against other local user accounts. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name CVE-2005-2977 to\nthis issue.\nAll users of pam should upgrade to this updated package, which contains\nbackported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
