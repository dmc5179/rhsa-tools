This could aid in the local\nexploitation of NULL pointer dereference bugs. (CVE-2009-2695, Important)\n* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the eCryptfs implementation\nin the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a local\ndenial of service or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2009-2908, Important)\n* a flaw was found in the NFSv4 implementation. The kernel would do an\nunnecessary permission check after creating a file. This check would\nusually fail and leave the file with the permission bits set to random\nvalues. Note: This is a server-side only issue. (CVE-2009-3286, Important)\n* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in each of the following\nfunctions in the Linux kernel: pipe_read_open(), pipe_write_open(), and\npipe_rdwr_open(). When the mutex lock is not held, the i_pipe pointer could\nbe released by other processes before it is used to update the pipe's\nreader and writer counters. This could lead to a local denial of service or\nprivilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3547, Important)\n* a flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux\nkernel. pci_unmap_single() presented a memory leak that could lead to IOMMU\nspace exhaustion and a system crash. An attacker on the local network could\nabuse this flaw by using jumbo frames for large amounts of network traffic.\n(CVE-2009-3613, Important)\n* missing initialization flaws were found in the Linux kernel. Padding data\nin several core network structures was not initialized properly before\nbeing sent to user-space. These flaws could lead to information leaks.\n(CVE-2009-3228, Moderate)\nBug fixes:\n* with network bonding in the \"balance-tlb\" or \"balance-alb\" mode, the\nprimary setting for the primary slave device was lost when said device was\nbrought down. Bringing the slave back up did not restore the primary\nsetting. (BZ#517971)\n* some faulty serial device hardware caused systems running the kernel-xen\nkernel to take a very long time to boot. (BZ#524153)\n* a caching bug in nfs_readdir() may have caused NFS clients to see\nduplicate files or not see all files in a directory. (BZ#526960)\n* the RHSA-2009:1243 update removed the mpt_msi_enable option, preventing\ncertain scripts from running. This update adds the option back. (BZ#526963)\n* an iptables rule with the recent module and a hit count value greater\nthan the ip_pkt_list_tot parameter (the default is 20), did not have any\neffect over packets, as the hit count could not be reached. (BZ#527434)\n* a check has been added to the IPv4 code to make sure that rt is not NULL,\nto help prevent future bugs in functions that call ip_append_data() from\nbeing exploitable. (BZ#527436)\n* a kernel panic occurred in certain conditions after reconfiguring a tape\ndrive's block size. (BZ#528133)\n* when using the Linux Virtual Server (LVS) in a master and backup\nconfiguration, and propagating active connections on the master to the\nbackup, the connection timeout value on the backup was hard-coded to 180\nseconds, meaning connection information on the backup was soon lost. This\ncould prevent the successful failover of connections. The timeout value\ncan now be set via \"ipvsadm --set\". (BZ#528645)\n* a bug in nfs4_do_open_expired() could have caused the reclaimer thread on\nan NFSv4 client to enter an infinite loop. (BZ#529162)\n* MSI interrupts may not have been delivered for r8169 based network cards\nthat have MSI interrupts enabled. This bug only affected certain systems.\n(BZ#529366)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
