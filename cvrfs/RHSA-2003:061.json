These\nbugs could be exploited by creating a carefully crafted image in such a way\nthat it executes arbitrary code when it is processed by either an\napplication from the netpbm-progs package or an application that uses the\nvulnerable netpbm library.\nOne way that an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities would be to \nsubmit a carefully crafted image to be printed, as the LPRng print spooler\nused by default in Red Hat Linux Advanced Products releases uses netpbm\nutilities to parse various types of image files.\nUsers are advised to upgrade to the updated packages, which contain patches\nthat correct these vulnerabilities.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
