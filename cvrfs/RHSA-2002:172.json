Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.

These updates fix a buffer overflow in the XDR decoder.","Sun RPC is a remote procedure call framework which allows clients to invoke\nprocedures in a server process over a network.  XDR is a mechanism for\nencoding data structures for use with RPC.  \nThe Kerberos 5 network authentication system contains an RPC library which\nincludes an XDR decoder derived from Sun's RPC implementation. The Sun\nimplementation was recently demonstrated to be vulnerable to a heap\noverflow.  It is believed that the attacker needs to be able to\nauthenticate to the kadmin daemon for this attack to be successful.  No\nexploits are known to currently exist.\nAll users should upgrade to these errata packages which contain an updated\nversion of Kerberos 5 which is not vulnerable to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
