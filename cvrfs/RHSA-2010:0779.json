Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,\nwhich give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability\nfrom the CVE links in the References section.","The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n* Information leak flaws were found in the Linux kernel Traffic Control\nUnit implementation. A local attacker could use these flaws to cause the\nkernel to leak kernel memory to user-space, possibly leading to the\ndisclosure of sensitive information. (CVE-2010-2942, Moderate)\n* A flaw was found in the tcf_act_police_dump() function in the Linux\nkernel network traffic policing implementation. A data structure in\ntcf_act_police_dump() was not initialized properly before being copied to\nuser-space. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause an\ninformation leak. (CVE-2010-3477, Moderate)\n* A missing upper bound integer check was found in the sys_io_submit()\nfunction in the Linux kernel asynchronous I/O implementation. A local,\nunprivileged user could use this flaw to cause an information leak.\n(CVE-2010-3067, Low)\nRed Hat would like to thank Tavis Ormandy for reporting CVE-2010-3067.\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n* When two systems using bonding devices in the adaptive load balancing\n(ALB) mode communicated with each other, an endless loop of ARP replies\nstarted between these two systems due to a faulty MAC address update. With\nthis update, the MAC address update no longer creates unneeded ARP replies.\n(BZ#629239)\n* When running the Connectathon NFS Testsuite with certain clients and Red\nHat Enterprise Linux 4.8 as the server, nfsvers4, lock, and test2 failed\nthe Connectathon test. (BZ#625535)\n* For UDP/UNIX domain sockets, due to insufficient memory barriers in the\nnetwork code, a process sleeping in select() may have missed notifications\nabout new data. In rare cases, this bug may have caused a process to sleep\nforever. (BZ#640117)\n* In certain situations, a bug found in either the HTB or TBF network\npacket schedulers in the Linux kernel could have caused a kernel panic when\nusing Broadcom network cards with the bnx2 driver. (BZ#624363)\n* Previously, allocating fallback cqr for DASD reserve/release IOCTLs\nfailed because it used the memory pool of the respective device. This\nupdate preallocates sufficient memory for a single reserve/release request.\n(BZ#626828)\n* In some situations a bug prevented \"force online\" succeeding for a DASD\ndevice. (BZ#626827)\n* Using the \"fsstress\" utility may have caused a kernel panic. (BZ#633968)\n* This update introduces additional stack guard patches. (BZ#632515)\n* A bug was found in the way the megaraid_sas driver handled physical disks\nand management IOCTLs. All physical disks were exported to the disk layer,\nallowing an oops in megasas_complete_cmd_dpc() when completing the IOCTL\ncommand if a timeout occurred. (BZ#631903)\n* Previously, a warning message was returned when a large amount of\nmessages was passed through netconsole and a considerable amount of network\nload was added. With this update, the warning message is no longer\ndisplayed. (BZ#637729)\n* Executing a large \"dd\" command (1 to 5GB) on an iSCSI device with the\nqla3xxx driver caused a system crash due to the incorrect storing of a\nprivate data structure. With this update, the size of the stored data\nstructure is checked and the system crashes no longer occur. (BZ#624364)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
