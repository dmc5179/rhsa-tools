update is now available for Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage 4.8.5 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.","Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage is software-defined storage integrated\nwith and optimized for the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.\nRed Hat OpenShift Container Storage is highly scalable, production-grade\npersistent storage for stateful applications running in the Red Hat\nOpenShift Container Platform. In addition to persistent storage, Red Hat\nOpenShift Container Storage provides a multicloud data management service\nwith an S3 compatible API.\nSecurity Fix(es):\n* nodejs-ssh2: Command injection by calling vulnerable method with\nuntrusted input (CVE-2020-26301)\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a\nCVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to\nthe CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\nBug Fix(es):\n* Previously, when the namespace store target was deleted, no alert was\nsent to the namespace bucket because of an issue in calculating the\nnamespace bucket health. With this update, the issue in calculating the\nnamespace bucket health is fixed and alerts are triggered as expected.\n(BZ#1993873)\n* Previously, the Multicloud Object Gateway (MCG) components performed\nslowly and there was a lot of pressure on the MCG components due to\nnon-optimized database queries. With this update the non-optimized\ndatabase queries are fixed which reduces the compute resources and time\ntaken for queries. (BZ#2015939)\nRed Hat recommends that all users of OpenShift Container Storage apply this update to fix these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
