A number of bug\nfixes and new features are also included.","Stronghold 4 contains a number of open source technologies, including\nOpenSSL 0.9.6 and mod_ssl.\nNISCC testing of implementations of the SSL protocol uncovered two bugs in\nOpenSSL 0.9.6.  The parsing of unusual ASN.1 tag values can cause OpenSSL\nto crash.  A remote attacker could trigger this bug by sending a carefully\ncrafted SSL client certificate to the Stronghold Web server, which would\ncause the server child process handling the request to terminate.  The\neffects of such an attack would be limited, as Apache is designed to handle\nthis situation.  In most cases, an attack would simply cause increased\nserver load, which would only last as long as an attacker continues to make\nmalicious connections.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CAN-2003-0543 and CAN-2003-0544 to\nthis issue.  \nBen Laurie found a bug in the optional renegotiation code in mod_ssl\nthat can cause cipher suite restrictions to be ignored. This is triggered\nif optional renegotiation is used (SSLOptions +OptRenegotiate) along with\nverification of client certificates and a change to the cipher suite over\nthe renegotiation.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0192 to this issue.\nUsers of Stronghold 4 cross-platform are advised to update to these errata\nversions, which contain backported security fixes and are not vulnerable to\nthese issues.\nRed Hat would like to thank NISCC, Stephen Henson, and Ben Laurie for their\nwork on these vulnerabilities.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
