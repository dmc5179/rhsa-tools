Packages have\nbeen updated with the correct fix.","Kerberos is a network authentication system which allows clients and\nservers to authenticate to each other through use of symmetric encryption\nand a trusted third party, the KDC.  kadmind is the KADM5 administration\nserver.\nTenable Network Security discovered a stack buffer overflow flaw in the RPC\nlibrary used by kadmind.   A remote unauthenticated attacker who can access\nkadmind could trigger this flaw and cause kadmind to crash.  On Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 5 it is not possible to exploit this flaw to run arbitrary\ncode as the overflow is blocked by FORTIFY_SOURCE.  (CVE-2007-3999)\nGarrett Wollman discovered an uninitialized pointer flaw in kadmind.  A\nremote unauthenticated attacker who can access kadmind could trigger this\nflaw and cause kadmind to crash.  (CVE-2007-4000)\nThese issues did not affect the versions of Kerberos distributed with Red\nHat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, or 4.\nUsers of krb5-server are advised to update to these erratum packages which\ncontain backported fixes to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
