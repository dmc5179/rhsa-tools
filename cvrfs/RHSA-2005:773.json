This flaw occurs if a virtual host is configured\nusing \"SSLVerifyClient optional\" and a directive \"SSLVerifyClient\nrequired\" is set for a specific location. For servers configured in this\nfashion, an attacker may be able to access resources that should otherwise\nbe protected, by not supplying a client certificate when connecting. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the name\nCAN-2005-2700 to this issue.\nUsers of mod_ssl should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a\nbackported patch to correct this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
