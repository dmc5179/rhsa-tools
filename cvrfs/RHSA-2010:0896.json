An HTML mail message containing\nmalicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird.\n(CVE-2010-3765)\nSeveral flaws were found in the processing of malformed HTML mail content.\nAn HTML mail message containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird\nto crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nuser running Thunderbird. (CVE-2010-3175, CVE-2010-3176, CVE-2010-3179,\nCVE-2010-3180, CVE-2010-3183)\nA same-origin policy bypass flaw was found in Thunderbird. Remote HTML\ncontent could steal private data from different remote HTML content\nThunderbird had loaded. (CVE-2010-3178)\nNote: JavaScript support is disabled by default in Thunderbird. The above\nissues are not exploitable unless JavaScript is enabled.\nA flaw was found in the script that launches Thunderbird. The\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH variable was appending a \".\" character, which could allow a\nlocal attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a different\nuser running Thunderbird, if that user ran Thunderbird from within an\nattacker-controlled directory. (CVE-2010-3182)\nAll Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which\nresolves these issues. All running instances of Thunderbird must be\nrestarted for the update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
