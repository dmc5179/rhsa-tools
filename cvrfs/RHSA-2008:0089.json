An unprivileged local\nuser could truncate directories to which they had write permission; this\ncould render the contents of the directory inaccessible. (CVE-2008-0001,\nImportant)\nA flaw was found in the Xen PAL emulation on Intel 64 platforms. A guest\nHardware-assisted virtual machine (HVM) could read the arbitrary physical\nmemory of the host system, which could make information available to\nunauthorized users. (CVE-2007-6416, Important)\nA flaw was found in the way core dump files were created. If a local user\ncan get a root-owned process to dump a core file into a directory, which\nthe user has write access to, they could gain read access to that core\nfile, potentially containing sensitive information. (CVE-2007-6206, Moderate)\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the CIFS virtual file system. A\nremote,authenticated user could issue a request that could lead to a denial\nof service. (CVE-2007-5904, Moderate)\nA flaw was found in the \"sysfs_readdir\" function. A local user could create\na race condition which would cause a denial of service (kernel oops).\n(CVE-2007-3104, Moderate)\nAs well, these updated packages fix the following bugs:\n* running the \"strace -f\" command caused strace to hang, without displaying\ninformation about child processes.\n* unmounting an unresponsive, interruptable NFS mount, for example, one\nmounted with the \"intr\" option, may have caused a system crash.\n* a bug in the s2io.ko driver prevented VLAN devices from being added.\nAttempting to add a device to a VLAN, for example, running the \"vconfig\nadd [device-name] [vlan-id]\" command caused vconfig to fail.\n* tux used an incorrect open flag bit. This caused problems when building\npackages in a chroot environment, such as mock, which is used by the koji\nbuild system.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5 users are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain backported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
