An\nuntrusted applet could use these vulnerabilities to access data from other\napplets. (CVE-2006-6736, CVE-2006-6737)\nBuffer overflow vulnerabilities were discovered in the Java Runtime\nEnvironment. An untrusted applet could use these flaws to elevate its\nprivileges, possibly reading and writing local files or executing local\napplications. (CVE-2006-6731)\nDaniel Bleichenbacher discovered an attack on PKCS #1 v1.5 signatures. If\nan RSA key with exponent 3 is used, it may be possible to forge a PKCS #1\nv1.5 signature which incorrectly verifies under implementations that do not\ncheck for excess data in the RSA exponentation result of the signature.\nAll users of IBMJava2 should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain IBM's 1.3.1 SR10a Java release which resolves these issues.\nPlease note that the packages in this erratum are the same as those we\nreleased on January 24th 2007 with advisories RHBA-2007:0023 and\nRHEA-2007:0024. We have issued this security update as these previous\nadvisories did not specify that they fixed critical security issues. If you\nhave already updated to those versions of IBMJava you will not need to\napply this update.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
