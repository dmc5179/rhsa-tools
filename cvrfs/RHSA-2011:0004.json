Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.","The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n* A flaw was found in sctp_packet_config() in the Linux kernel's Stream\nControl Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation. A remote attacker\ncould use this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2010-3432,\nImportant)\n* A missing integer overflow check was found in snd_ctl_new() in the Linux\nkernel's sound subsystem. A local, unprivileged user on a 32-bit system\ncould use this flaw to cause a denial of service or escalate their\nprivileges. (CVE-2010-3442, Important)\n* A heap overflow flaw in the Linux kernel's Transparent Inter-Process\nCommunication protocol (TIPC) implementation could allow a local,\nunprivileged user to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2010-3859, Important)\n* An integer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Reliable\nDatagram Sockets (RDS) protocol implementation. A local, unprivileged user\ncould use this flaw to cause a denial of service or escalate their\nprivileges. (CVE-2010-3865, Important)\n* A flaw was found in the Xenbus code for the unified block-device I/O\ninterface back end. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to cause a\ndenial of service on the host system running the Xen hypervisor.\n(CVE-2010-3699, Moderate)\n* Missing sanity checks were found in setup_arg_pages() in the Linux\nkernel. When making the size of the argument and environment area on the\nstack very large, it could trigger a BUG_ON(), resulting in a local denial\nof service. (CVE-2010-3858, Moderate)\n* A flaw was found in inet_csk_diag_dump() in the Linux kernel's module for\nmonitoring the sockets of INET transport protocols. By sending a netlink\nmessage with certain bytecode, a local, unprivileged user could cause a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2010-3880, Moderate)\n* Missing sanity checks were found in gdth_ioctl_alloc() in the gdth driver\nin the Linux kernel. A local user with access to \"/dev/gdth\" on a 64-bit\nsystem could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or escalate their\nprivileges. (CVE-2010-4157, Moderate)\n* The fix for Red Hat Bugzilla bug 484590 as provided in RHSA-2009:1243\nintroduced a regression. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to\ncause a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4161, Moderate)\n* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Bluetooth HCI UART\ndriver in the Linux kernel. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw\nto cause a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4242, Moderate)\n* It was found that a malicious guest running on the Xen hypervisor could\nplace invalid data in the memory that the guest shared with the blkback and\nblktap back-end drivers, resulting in a denial of service on the host\nsystem. (CVE-2010-4247, Moderate)\n* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's CPU time clocks implementation for\nthe POSIX clock interface. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw\nto cause a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4248, Moderate)\n* Missing initialization flaws in the Linux kernel could lead to\ninformation leaks. (CVE-2010-3876, CVE-2010-4083, Low)\nRed Hat would like to thank Dan Rosenberg for reporting CVE-2010-3442,\nCVE-2010-4161, and CVE-2010-4083; Thomas Pollet for reporting\nCVE-2010-3865; Brad Spengler for reporting CVE-2010-3858; Nelson Elhage for\nreporting CVE-2010-3880; Alan Cox for reporting CVE-2010-4242; and Vasiliy\nKulikov for reporting CVE-2010-3876.\nThis update also fixes several bugs and adds an enhancement. Documentation\nfor the bug fixes and the enhancement will be available shortly from the\nTechnical Notes document, linked to in the References section.\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues, and fix the bugs and add the enhancement\nnoted in the Technical Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update\nto take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
