As a result, removed packages were reinstalled, or, during and upgrade, the system tried to install two or more different versions at once, causing the upgrade to fail.\nIn this release, the dnf plugin has been fixed, and RPM packages are now properly removed.\nThe new version will also auto-heal the broken system by removing RPM packages which are not supposed to be in the persisted-rpms directory.
