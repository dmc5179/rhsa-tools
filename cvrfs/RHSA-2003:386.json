Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of\nup2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be\ndownloaded directly from the RHN website:\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003:386"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Moderate","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated FreeRADIUS packages are now available that fix a denial of service\nvulnerability.","FreeRADIUS is an Internet authentication daemon, which implements the\nRADIUS protocol.  It allows Network Access Servers (NAS boxes) to perform\nauthentication for dial-up users.\nThe rad_decode function in FreeRADIUS 0.9.2 and earlier allows remote\nattackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a short RADIUS string\nattribute with a tag, which causes memcpy to be called with a -1 length\nargument, as demonstrated using the Tunnel-Password attribute.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0967 to this issue.\nUsers of FreeRADIUS are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages\ncontaining FreeRADIUS 0.9.3 which is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
