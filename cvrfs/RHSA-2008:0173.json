(CVE-2008-0890)\nAs well, this updated package fixes the followings bugs:\n* when LDAP operations such as \"ldapsearch\" were issued while the server\nwas creating a browsing index for the suffix, Red Hat Directory Server\nhanged.\n* when a bind operation returned LDAP controls, such as in pass-through\nauthentication, Red Hat Directory Server crashed.\n* if multiple-simultaneous LDAP operations were issued on entries, which\nwere indexed in a VLV index, Red Hat Directory Server hanged.\n* minor memory leaks, including memory leaks in replication, SASL, and\nindexing, have been resolved.\n* the Red Hat Directory Server crashed during start up if a log rotation\nfile, such as \"access.rotationinfo\", had a size value of 0 bytes.\n* on 64-bit platforms, LDAP search operations would intermittently time\nout, causing them to fail.\n* it was not possible to send data larger than 512 bytes through SASL\nGSSAPI. Connections failed with a message decoding error.\n* when the password lockout option was set, previous log in failures were\nnot cleared from the passwordCount attribute, even after a successful log\nin.\n* when an entry had a NULL attribute value for an attribute in a VLV index,\nediting the entry caused Red Hat Directory Server to crash.\n* repeatedly removing and adding the same replica and replication\nagreement, caused Red Hat Directory Server to crash.\n* random operation failures occurred when multiple-simultaneous SASL\noperations were initiated.\n* while VLV indexes were being created, Red Hat Directory Server ignored\nstop operations. Stop operations sent during index creation hanged.\n* adding an invalid DN syntax caused Red Hat Directory Server to crash,\ninstead of rejecting the entry.\n* modify operations that included an invalid attribute value, caused Red\nHat Directory server to crash.\n* malformed member URLs for dynamic groups, such as ones missing the\nterminal parentheses, caused Red Hat Directory Server to crash.\n* in the previous redhat-ds package, SASL mappings were hard coded. In\nthis updated package, SASL mappings use regular expressions, that are\ndynamically generated on start up. A \"*\" character can no longer be used\nfor the SASL mapping search filter.\n* repeatedly creating and deleting databases with VLV indexes, caused Red\nHat Directory Server to crash.\n* editing an entry with an attribute with non-ASCII values, and indexed\nwith a substring index, caused Red Hat Directory Server to crash.\n* in the previous redhat-ds package, SASL operations did not properly\nswitch the SASL I/O function set to the original I/O function set.\n* during online replication initialization, if the data included any entry\nlarger than 80% of the entry cache size, Red Hat Directory Server crashed.\n* online-replication initialization hanged endlessly when the import data\nincluded two consecutive entries, which totaled more than 80% of the entry\ncache size.\nFor further information, please refer to the Red Hat Directory Server 7.1\nSP4 release notes:\nhttp://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/dir-server/release-notes/7.1SP4/\nUsers of redhat-ds are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\nresolves these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
