An attacker could create a specially crafted HTML mail, which\nwhen viewed by the victim would cause Thunderbird to crash or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. Thunderbird as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux 4 must have international domain names enabled by the user in order\nto be vulnerable to this issue. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-2871 to this issue.\nA bug was found in the way Thunderbird processes certain Unicode sequences.\nIt may be possible to execute arbitrary code as the user running\nThunderbird if the user views a specially crafted HTML mail containing\nUnicode sequences. (CAN-2005-2702)\nA bug was found in the way Thunderbird makes XMLHttp requests. It is\npossible that a malicious HTML mail could leverage this flaw to exploit\nother proxy or server flaws from the victim's machine. It is also possible\nthat this flaw could be leveraged to send XMLHttp requests to hosts other\nthan the originator; the default behavior of Thunderbird is to disallow\nsuch actions. (CAN-2005-2703)\nA bug was found in the way Thunderbird implemented its XBL interface. It\nmay be possible for a malicious HTML mail to create an XBL binding in such\na way that would allow arbitrary JavaScript execution with chrome\npermissions. Please note that in Thunderbird 1.0.6 this issue is not\ndirectly exploitable and will need to leverage other unknown exploits.\n(CAN-2005-2704)\nAn integer overflow bug was found in Thunderbird's JavaScript engine. Under\nfavorable conditions, it may be possible for a malicious mail message to\nexecute arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird. Please note that\nJavaScript support is disabled by default in Thunderbird. (CAN-2005-2705)\nA bug was found in the way Thunderbird displays about: pages. It is\npossible for a malicious HTML mail to open an about: page, such as\nabout:mozilla, in such a way that it becomes possible to execute JavaScript\nwith chrome privileges. (CAN-2005-2706)\nA bug was found in the way Thunderbird opens new windows. It is possible\nfor a malicious HTML mail to construct a new window without any user\ninterface components, such as the address bar and the status bar. This\nwindow could then be used to mislead the user for malicious purposes.\n(CAN-2005-2707)\nA bug was found in the way Thunderbird processes URLs passed to it on the\ncommand line. If a user passes a malformed URL to Thunderbird, such as\nclicking on a link in an instant messaging program, it is possible to\nexecute arbitrary commands as the user running Thunderbird. (CAN-2005-2968) \nUsers of Thunderbird are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains Thunderbird version 1.0.7 and is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
