The address parser performs insufficient bounds checking\nin certain conditions due to a char to int conversion, making it possible\nfor an attacker to take control of the application.  This issue is probably\nlocally exploitable and may also be remotely exploitable.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0161 to this issue.\nDuring a code audit of Sendmail by ISS, a critical vulnerability was\nuncovered that affects unpatched versions of Sendmail prior to version\n8.12.8. A remote attacker can send a carefully crafted email message\nwhich, when processed by Sendmail, causes arbitrary code to be\nexecuted as root. A proof-of-concept exploit is reported to exist, but is\nnot believed to be publicly available.\nSince this vulnerability is message-based, MTAs other than Sendmail\nmay pass on the carefully crafted message. This means that unpatched\nversions of Sendmail inside a network could still be at risk even if\nthey do not accept external connections directly.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2002-1337 to this issue.\nIn addition, the restricted shell (SMRSH) in Sendmail allows attackers to\nbypass the intended restrictions of smrsh by inserting additional commands\nafter \"||\" sequences or \"/\" characters, which are not properly filtered or\nverified. A successful attack would allow an attacker who has a local\naccount on a system which has explicitly enabled smrsh to execute arbitrary\nbinaries as themselves by utilizing their .forward file. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2002-1165 to this issue.\nAll users are advised to update to these erratum packages containing\nbackported patches which correct these vulnerabilities.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
