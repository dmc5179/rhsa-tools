A malicious DNS server could crash Squid by sending a carefully\ncrafted DNS response to an FQDN lookup.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0446 to\nthis issue.  \nThis erratum also includes two minor patches to the LDAP helpers.  One \ncorrects a slight malformation in ldap search requests (although all \nknown LDAP servers accept the requests).  The other adds documentation \nfor the -v option to the ldap helpers. \nUsers of Squid should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a  \nbackported patch, and is not vulnerable to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
