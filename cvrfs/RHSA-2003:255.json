Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.

The intended\nbehaviour is that only packages signed with the Red Hat package signing key\nare installed. \nBecause connections to the Red Hat Network servers are authenticated and\nverified using of SSL, it is nearly impossible to intercept the connection\nto Red Hat Network servers and supply unsigned packages. For this reason,\nto take advantage of this exploit an attacker must compromise the Red Hat\nNetwork servers at Red Hat and make unsigned packages appear on Red Hat\nNetwork.\nThese facts make the risk of exploiting this bug very low. However,\nit is advised that all users of up2date install the packages contained\nwithin this erratum, which correct this issue by rejecting and refusing to\ninstall any packages with no GPG signature -- treating such packages in the\nsame way as those with bad GPG signatures.\nNote: All other variations of package signature checking work correctly. \nRed Hat would like to thank Barry Nathan for finding and reporting this error.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
