If a certain link type was explicitly specified, an\nattacker could inject a carefully crafted frame onto the IEEE 802.11\nnetwork that could crash a running tcpdump session. (CVE-2007-1218)\nAn integer overflow flaw was found in tcpdump's BGP processing code. An\nattacker could execute arbitrary code with the privilege of the pcap user\nby injecting a crafted frame onto the network. (CVE-2007-3798)\nIn addition, the following bugs have been addressed:\n* The arpwatch service initialization script would exit prematurely,\nreturning an incorrect successful exit status and preventing the status\ncommand from running in case networking is not available.\n* Tcpdump would not drop root privileges completely when launched with the\n-C option. This might have been abused by an attacker to gain root\nprivileges in case a security problem was found in tcpdump. Users of\ntcpdump are encouraged to specify meaningful arguments to the -Z option in\ncase they want tcpdump to write files with privileges other than of the\npcap user.\nUsers of tcpdump are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain backported patches that correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
