An attacker could create a carefully crafted PNG\nimage file in such a way that it could cause an application linked with\nlibpng to crash or execute arbitrary code when the file is opened by a\nvictim. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the\nname CVE-2006-0481 to this issue.\nPlease note that the vunerable libpng function is only used by TeTeX and\nXEmacs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.\nAll users of libpng are advised to update to these updated packages which\ncontain a backported patch that is not vulnerable to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
