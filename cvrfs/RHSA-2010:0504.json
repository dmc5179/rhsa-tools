Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.","The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n* multiple flaws were found in the mmap and mremap implementations. A local\nuser could use these flaws to cause a local denial of service or escalate\ntheir privileges. (CVE-2010-0291, Important)\n* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Fast Userspace Mutexes\n(futexes) implementation. The unlock code path did not check if the futex\nvalue associated with pi_state->owner had been modified. A local user could\nuse this flaw to modify the futex value, possibly leading to a denial of\nservice or privilege escalation when the pi_state->owner pointer is\ndereferenced. (CVE-2010-0622, Important)\n* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel Network\nFile System (NFS) implementation. A local user on a system that has an\nNFS-mounted file system could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or\nescalate their privileges on that system. (CVE-2010-1087, Important)\n* a flaw was found in the sctp_process_unk_param() function in the Linux\nkernel Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation. A remote\nattacker could send a specially-crafted SCTP packet to an SCTP listening\nport on a target system, causing a kernel panic (denial of service).\n(CVE-2010-1173, Important)\n* a flaw was found in the Linux kernel Transparent Inter-Process\nCommunication protocol (TIPC) implementation. If a client application, on a\nlocal system where the tipc module is not yet in network mode, attempted to\nsend a message to a remote TIPC node, it would dereference a NULL pointer\non the local system, causing a kernel panic (denial of service).\n(CVE-2010-1187, Important)\n* a buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel Global File System 2\n(GFS2) implementation. In certain cases, a quota could be written past the\nend of a memory page, causing memory corruption, leaving the quota stored\non disk in an invalid state. A user with write access to a GFS2 file system\ncould trigger this flaw to cause a kernel crash (denial of service) or\nescalate their privileges on the GFS2 server. This issue can only be\ntriggered if the GFS2 file system is mounted with the \"quota=on\" or\n\"quota=account\" mount option. (CVE-2010-1436, Important)\n* a race condition between finding a keyring by name and destroying a freed\nkeyring was found in the Linux kernel key management facility. A local user\ncould use this flaw to cause a kernel panic (denial of service) or escalate\ntheir privileges. (CVE-2010-1437, Important)\n* a flaw was found in the link_path_walk() function in the Linux kernel.\nUsing the file descriptor returned by the open() function with the\nO_NOFOLLOW flag on a subordinate NFS-mounted file system, could result in a\nNULL pointer dereference, causing a denial of service or privilege\nescalation. (CVE-2010-1088, Moderate)\n* a missing permission check was found in the gfs2_set_flags() function in\nthe Linux kernel GFS2 implementation. A local user could use this flaw to\nchange certain file attributes of files, on a GFS2 file system, that they\ndo not own. (CVE-2010-1641, Low)\nRed Hat would like to thank Jukka Taimisto and Olli Jarva of Codenomicon\nLtd, Nokia Siemens Networks, and Wind River on behalf of their customer,\nfor responsibly reporting CVE-2010-1173; Mario Mikocevic for responsibly\nreporting CVE-2010-1436; and Dan Rosenberg for responsibly reporting\nCVE-2010-1641.\nThis update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these bug fixes will\nbe available shortly from\nhttp://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/errata/RHSA-2010-0504/Kernel_Security_Update/index.html\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
