The MIT Kerberos team\nreleased an advisory describing a number of vulnerabilities that affect the\nkerberos packages shipped by Red Hat.\nAn integer signedness error in the ASN.1 decoder before version 1.2.5\nallows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a large unsigned\ndata element length, which is later used as a negative value.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name CAN-2002-0036\nto this issue.  \nThe Key Distribution Center (KDC) before version 1.2.5 allows remote,\nauthenticated, attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) on KDCs\nwithin the same realm via a certain protocol request that:\n- causes a null pointer dereference (CAN-2003-0058).\n- causes the KDC to corrupt its heap (CAN-2003-0082).\nA vulnerability in Kerberos before version 1.2.3 allows users from\none realm to impersonate users in other realms that have the same\ninter-realm keys (CAN-2003-0059).\nThe MIT advisory for these issues also mentions format string\nvulnerabilities in the logging routines (CAN-2003-0060).  Previous versions\nof the kerberos packages from Red Hat already contain fixes for this issue.\nVulnerabilities have been found in the implementation of support for\ntriple-DES keys in the implementation of the Kerberos IV authentication\nprotocol included in MIT Kerberos (CAN-2003-0139).\nVulnerabilities have been found in the Kerberos IV authentication protocol\nwhich allow an attacker with knowledge of a cross-realm key that is shared\nwith another realm to impersonate any principal in that realm to any\nservice in that realm.  This vulnerability can only be closed by disabling\ncross-realm authentication in Kerberos IV (CAN-2003-0138).\nVulnerabilities have been found in the RPC library used by the kadmin\nservice in Kerberos 5.  A faulty length check in the RPC library exposes\nkadmind to an integer overflow which can be used to crash kadmind\n(CAN-2003-0028).\nAll users of Kerberos are advised to upgrade to these errata packages,\nwhich disable cross-realm authentication by default for Kerberos IV and\nwhich contain backported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
