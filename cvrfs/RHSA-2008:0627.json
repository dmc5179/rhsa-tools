This update\nincludes a fix for a security issue in a Red Hat Network Proxy Server\ncomponent.\nThis update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat\nSecurity Response Team.","The Red Hat Network Proxy Server 5.1.1 release corrects a security\nvulnerability in a shipped component. In a typical operating environment,\nthis component is not exposed to users of Proxy Server in a vulnerable\nmanner. This security update will reduce risk in unique Proxy Server\nenvironments.\nA flaw was found in the mod_perl \"ModPerl::RegistryCooker\" class. If a\nserver implemented a mod_perl registry module using the\n\"namespace_from_uri\" method, a remote attacker requesting a carefully\ncrafted URI can cause resource consumption, which could lead to a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2007-1349)\nUsers of Red Hat Network Proxy Server 5.1 are advised to upgrade to 5.1.1,\nwhich resolves this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
