A separate\nadvisory  deals with updated PostgreSQL packages for Red Hat Linux 7.3 and 8.0.","PostgreSQL is an advanced Object-Relational database management system\n(DBMS).  A number of security issues have been found that affect PostgreSQL\nversions shipped with Red Hat Linux.  \nBuffer overflows in PostgreSQL 7.2 allow attackers to cause a denial of\nservice and possibly execute arbitrary code via long arguments to the lpad\nor rpad functions. CAN-2002-0972\nBuffer overflow in the cash_words() function for PostgreSQL 7.2 and\nearlier allows local users to cause a denial of service and possibly\nexecute arbitrary code via a malformed argument.  CAN-2002-1397\nBuffer overflow in the date parser for PostgreSQL before 7.2.2 allows\nattackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary\ncode via a long date string, also known as a vulnerability \"in handling\nlong datetime input.\"  CAN-2002-1398\nHeap-based buffer overflow in the repeat() function for PostgreSQL\nbefore 7.2.2 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code by causing\nrepeat() to generate a large string.  CAN-2002-1400\nBuffer overflows in circle_poly, path_encode and path_add allow attackers\nto cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code.   Note\nthat these issues have been fixed in our packages and in PostgreSQL CVS,\nbut are not included in PostgreSQL version 7.2.2 or 7.2.3.  CAN-2002-1401\nBuffer overflows in the TZ and SET TIME ZONE enivronment variables for\nPostgreSQL 7.2.1 and earlier allow local users to cause a denial of service\nand possibly execute arbitrary code.  CAN-2002-1402\nNote that these vulnerabilities are only critical on open or shared systems\nbecause connecting to the database is required before the vulnerabilities\ncan be exploited.\nThe PostgreSQL Global Development Team has released versions of PostgreSQL\nthat fixes these vulnerabilities, and these fixes have been isolated and\nbackported to the various versions of PostgreSQL that originally shipped\nwith each Red Hat Linux distribution.  All users of  PostgreSQL are advised\nto install these updated packages.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
