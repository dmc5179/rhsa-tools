It\nis possible for an attacker to create a specially crafted GIF image, which\nwhen viewed by a victim will execute arbitrary code as the victim. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2005-0399 to this issue.\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla responds to proxy auth requests. It is\npossible for a malicious webserver to steal credentials from a victims\nbrowser by issuing a 407 proxy authentication request. (CAN-2005-0147)\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla displays dialog windows. It is possible\nthat a malicious web page which is being displayed in a background tab\ncould present the user with a dialog window appearing to come from the\nactive page. (CAN-2004-1380)\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla Mail handles cookies when loading\ncontent over HTTP regardless of the user's preference. It is possible that\na particular user could be tracked through the use of malicious mail\nmessages which load content over HTTP. (CAN-2005-0149)\nA flaw was found in the way Mozilla displays international domain names. It\nis possible for an attacker to display a valid URL, tricking the user into\nthinking they are viewing a legitimate webpage when they are not.\n(CAN-2005-0233)\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla handles pop-up windows. It is possible\nfor a malicious website to control the content in an unrelated site's\npop-up window. (CAN-2004-1156)\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla saves temporary files. Temporary files\nare saved with world readable permissions, which could allow a local\nmalicious user to view potentially sensitive data. (CAN-2005-0142)\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla handles synthetic middle click events. \nIt is possible for a malicious web page to steal the contents of a victims\nclipboard. (CAN-2005-0146)\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla processes XUL content.  If a malicious\nweb page can trick a user into dragging an object, it is possible to load\nmalicious XUL content. (CAN-2005-0401)\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla loads links in a new tab which are\nmiddle clicked. A malicious web page could read local files or modify\nprivileged chrom settings. (CAN-2005-0141)\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla displays the secure site icon. A\nmalicious web page can use a view-source URL targetted at a secure page,\nwhile loading an insecure page, yet the secure site icon shows the previous\nsecure state. (CAN-2005-0144)\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla displays the secure site icon. A\nmalicious web page can display the secure site icon by loading a binary\nfile from a secured site. (CAN-2005-0143)\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla displays the download dialog window. A\nmalicious site can obfuscate the content displayed in the source field,\ntricking a user into thinking they are downloading content from a trusted\nsource.
