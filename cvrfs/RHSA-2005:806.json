It is possible for a local\nmalicious user to modify the permissions of a local file if they have write\naccess to a directory in which a cpio archive is being extracted. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name\nCVE-2005-1111 to this issue.\nIt was discovered that cpio uses a 0 umask when creating files using the -O\n(archive) option. This creates output files with mode 0666 (all users can\nread and write) regardless of the user's umask setting. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCVE-1999-1572 to this issue.\nAll users of cpio are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported fixes for these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
