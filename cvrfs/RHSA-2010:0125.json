Developers can write scripts to collect data on the\noperation of the system.\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in SystemTap's tapset __get_argv()\nfunction. If a privileged user ran a SystemTap script that called this\nfunction, a local, unprivileged user could, while that script is still\nrunning, trigger this flaw and cause memory corruption by running a command\nwith a large argument list, which may lead to a system crash or,\npotentially, arbitrary code execution with root privileges. (CVE-2010-0411)\nNote: SystemTap scripts that call __get_argv(), being a privileged\nfunction, can only be executed by the root user or users in the stapdev\ngroup. As well, if such a script was compiled and installed by root, users\nin the stapusr group would also be able to execute it.\nSystemTap users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a\nbackported patch to correct this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
