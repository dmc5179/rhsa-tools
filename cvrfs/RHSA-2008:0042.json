In some configurations it allowed remote authenticated users to\nread files accessible to the local tomcat process. (CVE-2007-5461)\nThe default security policy in the JULI logging component did not restrict\naccess permissions to files. This could be misused by untrusted web\napplications to access and write arbitrary files in the context of the\ntomcat process. (CVE-2007-5342)\nUsers of Tomcat should update to these errata packages, which contain\nbackported patches and are not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
