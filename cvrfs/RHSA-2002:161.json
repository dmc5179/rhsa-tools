It has not \nbeen verified if this issue could lead to further consequences such as \nremote code execution.\nThese errata packages contain a patch to correct this vulnerability. \nPlease note that the original patch from the OpenSSL team had a mistake in\nit which could possibly still allow buffer overflows to occur.  This bug \nis also fixed in these errata packages.\nNOTE:\nPlease read the Solution section below as it contains instructions for\nmaking sure that all SSL-enabled processes are restarted after the update\nis applied.\nThanks go to the OpenSSL team for providing patches for these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
