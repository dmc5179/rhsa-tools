Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.","The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n* When an application has a stack overflow, the stack could silently\noverwrite another memory mapped area instead of a segmentation fault\noccurring, which could cause an application to execute arbitrary code,\npossibly leading to privilege escalation. It is known that the X Window\nSystem server can be used to trigger this flaw. (CVE-2010-2240, Important)\n* A miscalculation of the size of the free space of the initial directory\nentry in a directory leaf block was found in the Linux kernel Global File\nSystem 2 (GFS2) implementation. A local, unprivileged user with write\naccess to a GFS2-mounted file system could perform a rename operation on\nthat file system to trigger a NULL pointer dereference, possibly resulting\nin a denial of service or privilege escalation. (CVE-2010-2798, Important)\nRed Hat would like to thank the X.Org security team for reporting\nCVE-2010-2240, with upstream acknowledging Rafal Wojtczuk as the original\nreporter; and Grant Diffey of CenITex for reporting CVE-2010-2798.\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n* Problems receiving network traffic correctly via a non-standard layer 3\nprotocol when using the ixgbe driver. This update corrects this issue.\n(BZ#618275)\n* A bug was found in the way the megaraid_sas driver (for SAS based RAID\ncontrollers) handled physical disks and management IOCTLs. All physical\ndisks were exported to the disk layer, allowing an oops in\nmegasas_complete_cmd_dpc() when completing the IOCTL command if a timeout\noccurred. One possible trigger for this bug was running \"mkfs\". This update\nresolves this issue by updating the megaraid_sas driver to version 4.31.\n(BZ#619363)\n* Previously, Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI) resulted in PCI bus writes\nto mask and unmask the MSI IRQ for a PCI device. These unnecessary PCI bus\nwrites resulted in the serialization of MSIs, leading to poor performance\non systems with high MSI load. This update adds a new kernel boot\nparameter, msi_nolock, which forgoes the PCI bus writes and allows for\nbetter simultaneous processing of MSIs. (BZ#621939)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
