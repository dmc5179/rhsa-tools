Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,\nwhich give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability\nfrom the CVE links in the References section.","Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.\nSeveral flaws were found in the processing of malformed HTML content.\nMalicious HTML content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially,\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird.\n(CVE-2010-3776, CVE-2010-3777)\nNote: JavaScript support is disabled in Thunderbird for mail messages. The\nabove issues are believed to not be exploitable without JavaScript.\nThis update adds support for the Sanitiser for OpenType (OTS) library to Thunderbird. This library helps prevent potential exploits in malformed OpenType fonts by verifying the font file prior to use. (CVE-2010-3768)\nAll Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which\nresolves these issues. All running instances of Thunderbird must be\nrestarted for the update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
