This advisory provides fixed packages for Red Hat Linux 8.0.","The dhcp package provides the ISC Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\n(DHCP) server and relay agent.  DHCP is a protocol that allows devices to\nget their own network configuration information from a server.\nFlorian Lohoff reported that the ISC dhcrelay (dhcp-relay) in 3.0rc9 and\nearlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (packet\nstorm) by constructing a malicious BOOTP packet that is forwarded to a\nbroadcast MAC address, causing an infinite loop.\nRed Hat Linux 8.0 shipped with a version of DHCP that is vulnerable to\nthis issue.  Other distributions of Red Hat Linux and Red Hat Linux\nAdvanced Server are based on version 2 of DHCP, and are not vulnerable to\nthis issue.\nThese erratum packages contain a patch that introduces a new command line\nswitch to dhcrelay, \"-c maxcount\".  This switch can be used to limit the\nhopcount and so avoid any infinite loops.  We advise users of dhcp-relay to\nspecify a small number for the maximum hop count; for example \"dhcrelay -c 10\".","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
