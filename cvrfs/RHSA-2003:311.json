Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate \nErrors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated \ncertificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat \nFTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003:311"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Low","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated Pan packages that close a denial of service vulnerability are now\navailable.","Pan is a Gnome/GTK+ newsreader.\nA bug in Pan versions prior to 0.13.4 can cause Pan to crash when parsing\nan article header containing a very long author email address.

The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2003-0855 to this issue.\nUsers of Pan are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain a backported patch correcting this issue.\nRed Hat would like to thank Kasper Dupont for alerting us to this issue and\nto Charles Kerr for providing the patch.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
