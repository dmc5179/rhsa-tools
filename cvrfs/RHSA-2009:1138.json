IPsec uses strong cryptography to provide\nboth authentication and encryption services. These services allow you to\nbuild secure tunnels through untrusted networks. Everything passing through\nthe untrusted network is encrypted by the IPsec gateway machine, and\ndecrypted by the gateway at the other end of the tunnel. The resulting\ntunnel is a virtual private network (VPN).\nMultiple insufficient input validation flaws were found in the way\nOpenswan's pluto IKE daemon processed some fields of X.509 certificates. A\nremote attacker could provide a specially-crafted X.509 certificate that\nwould crash the pluto daemon. (CVE-2009-2185)\nAll users of openswan are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain a backported patch to correct these issues. After installing\nthis update, the ipsec service will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
