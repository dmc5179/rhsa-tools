Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate \nErrors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated \ncertificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat \nFTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003:265"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated Sendmail packages that fix a vulnerability in the handling of DNS\nmaps are now available.\n[Updated 8 Sept 2003]\nThe original packages in this erratum were not stripped, making them larger\nthan they should have been.  We have now included updated packages that are\nstripped.  There has been no change to the source packages.","Sendmail is a widely used Mail Transport Agent (MTA) and is included in all\nRed Hat Linux distributions.\nA bug has been discovered in the handling of DNS maps in Sendmail 8.12\nversions before 8.12.9. A remote attacker can exploit this issue to\ncrash the instance of Sendmail dealing with the request. Red Hat believes\nthat the nature of the bug would make remote exploitation of this issue\ndifficult, if at all possible. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0688 to this issue.\nRed Hat Linux 8.0 and 9 both include versions of Sendmail vulnerable to\nthis issue; however it only affects sites that use DNS maps through the\n\"enhdnsbl\" feature.\nSendmail users that have enabled DNS maps are advised to update to the\npackages contained within this erratum, which include a backported patch\ncorrecting this vulnerability.\nRed Hat would like to thank the Sendmail security team for notifying us of\nthis issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
