This could allow a local\nunprivileged user to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2008-2136, Important)\nAs well, these updated packages fix the following bugs:\n* a possible kernel hang on hugemem systems, due to a bug in NFS, which may\nhave caused systems to become unresponsive, has been resolved.\n* an inappropriate exit condition occurred in the architecture-specific\n\"mmap()\" realization, which fell into an infinite loop under certain\nconditions. On 64-bit systems, this issue may have manifested itself to\nusers as a soft lockup, or process hangs.\n* due to a bug in hardware initialization in the \"ohci_hcd\" kernel module,\nthe kernel may have failed with a NULL pointer dereference. On 64-bit\nPowerPC systems, this may have caused booting to fail, and drop to xmon. On\nother platforms, a kernel oops occurred.\n* due to insufficient locks in task termination code, a panic may have\noccurred in the \"sys_times()\" system call on SMP machines.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain backported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
