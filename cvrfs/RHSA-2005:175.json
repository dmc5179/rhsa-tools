A\nmalicious local user could make use of this flaw to modify the /etc/hosts\nor /etc/resolv.conf files, which could be used to spoof domain information. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2005-0205 to this issue.\nPlease note that the default installation of kppp on Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux uses consolehelper and is not vulnerable to this issue.  However, the\nkppp FAQ provides instructions for removing consolehelper and running kppp\nsuid root, which is a vulnerable configuration.\nUsers of kdenetwork should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\na backported patch, and are not vulnerable to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
