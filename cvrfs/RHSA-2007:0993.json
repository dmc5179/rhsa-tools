A\nlocal user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory\nexhaustion). (CVE-2007-5494, Important)\nA flaw was found in the handling of IEEE 802.11 frames affecting several\nwireless LAN modules.  In certain circumstances, a remote attacker could\ntrigger this flaw by sending a malicious packet over a wireless network and\ncause a denial of service (kernel crash). (CVE-2007-4997, Important). \nA flaw was found in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA). A local\nuser who had the ability to read the /proc/driver/snd-page-alloc file could\nsee portions of kernel memory. (CVE-2007-4571, Moderate). \nIn addition to the security issues described above, several bug fixes\npreventing possible memory corruption, system crashes, SCSI I/O fails,\nnetworking drivers performance regression and journaling block device layer\nissue were also included.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5 users are advised to upgrade to these packages,\nwhich contain backported patches to resolve these issues.\nRed Hat would like to credit Vasily Averin, Chris Evans, and Neil Kettle \nfor reporting the security issues corrected by this update.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
