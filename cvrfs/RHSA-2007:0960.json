A local attacker could send a specially crafted request to the hpssd\ndaemon, possibly allowing them to run arbitrary commands as the root user.\n(CVE-2007-5208). On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, the SELinux targeted\npolicy for hpssd which is enabled by default, blocks the ability to exploit\nthis issue to run arbitrary code.\nUsers of hplip are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to resolve this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
