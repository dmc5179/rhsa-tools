These bugs include the use of \na PHP script as an ErrorDocument and possible POST body corruption in some\nconfigurations.\nAlso included is a fix for a minor security problem. In PHP version 4.3.1\nand earlier, when transparent session ID support is enabled using the\n\"session.use_trans_sid\" option, the session ID is not escaped before use. \nThis allows a Cross Site Scripting attack.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0442 to\nthis issue.\nAll users of PHP are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain back-ported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
