A remote attacker could send a specially crafted\nNTLM authentication request which would cause the Squid server to crash. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the name\nCVE-2005-2917 to this issue.\nSeveral bugs have also been addressed in this update:\n* An error introduced in 2.5.STABLE3-6.3E.14 where Squid can crash if a\nuser visits a site which has a long DNS record.\n* Some authentication helpers were missing needed setuid rights.\n* Squid couldn't handle a reply from a HTTP server when the reply began\nwith the new-line character or wasn't HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1 compliant.\n* User-defined error pages were not kept when the squid package was upgraded.\nAll users of squid should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
