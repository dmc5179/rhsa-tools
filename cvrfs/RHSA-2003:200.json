Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003:200"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Moderate","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated unzip packages resolving a vulnerability allowing arbitrary files\nto be overwritten are now available.\n[Updated 15 August 2003]\nBen Laurie found that the original patch to fix this issue missed a case\nwhere the path component included a quoted slash. These updated packages\ncontain a new patch that corrects this issue.","The unzip utility is used for manipulating archives, which are multiple\nfiles stored inside of a single file.\nA vulnerabilitiy in unzip version 5.50 and earlier allows attackers to\noverwrite arbitrary files during archive extraction by placing invalid\n(non-printable) characters between two \".\" characters. These non-printable\ncharacters are filtered, resulting in a \"..\" sequence. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0282 to this issue.\nThis erratum includes a patch ensuring that non-printable characters do not\nmake it possible for a malicious .zip file to write to parent directories\nunless the \"-:\" command line parameter is specified.\nUsers of unzip are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which are\nnot vulnerable to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
