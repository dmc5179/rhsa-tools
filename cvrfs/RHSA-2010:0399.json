TeX takes a text file and a set of\nformatting commands as input, and creates a typesetter-independent DeVice\nIndependent (DVI) file as output.\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the way teTeX processed virtual font\nfiles when converting DVI files into PostScript. An attacker could create a\nmalicious DVI file that would cause the dvips executable to crash or,\npotentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-0827)\nMultiple integer overflow flaws were found in the way teTeX processed\nspecial commands when converting DVI files into PostScript. An attacker\ncould create a malicious DVI file that would cause the dvips executable to\ncrash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-0739,\nCVE-2010-1440)\nA stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way teTeX processed DVI\nfiles containing HyperTeX references with long titles, when converting them\ninto PostScript. An attacker could create a malicious DVI file that would\ncause the dvips executable to crash. (CVE-2007-5935)\nteTeX embeds a copy of Xpdf, an open source Portable Document Format (PDF)\nfile viewer, to allow adding images in PDF format to the generated PDF\ndocuments. The following issues affect Xpdf code:\nMultiple integer overflow flaws were found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder. If a\nlocal user generated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing a\nspecially-crafted PDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash or, potentially,\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running pdflatex.\n(CVE-2009-0147, CVE-2009-1179)\nMultiple integer overflow flaws were found in Xpdf. If a local user\ngenerated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing a specially-crafted\nPDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the user running pdflatex. (CVE-2009-0791,\nCVE-2009-3609)\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder. If a\nlocal user generated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing a\nspecially-crafted PDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash or, potentially,\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running pdflatex.\n(CVE-2009-0195)\nMultiple buffer overflow flaws were found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder. If a\nlocal user generated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing a\nspecially-crafted PDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash or, potentially,\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running pdflatex.\n(CVE-2009-0146, CVE-2009-1182)\nMultiple flaws were found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder that could lead to the\nfreeing of arbitrary memory. If a local user generated a PDF file from a\nTeX document, referencing a specially-crafted PDF file, it would cause\nXpdf to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges\nof the user running pdflatex. (CVE-2009-0166, CVE-2009-1180)\nMultiple input validation flaws were found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder.
