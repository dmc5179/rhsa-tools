The modules in earlier dlm-kernel packages failed to\nload because they did not match the running kernel. It was possible to\nforce load the modules. With this update, however, users no longer need to.\nAs well, the following issues have been addressed in this update:\n* a bug was fixed which could cause a crash when /proc/cluster/dlm_locks\nwas viewed.\n* a bug was fixed which caused dlm operations to block when a tcp\nconnection was initiated to the dlm port.\n* a bug was fixed which caused cman to incorrectly report that clvmd\nstartup failed.\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these latest dlm-kernel packages, which are\nupdated for use with the 2.6.9-55.0.6.EL kernel.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
