It is possible for a local\nuser with permissions to execute /sbin/service via sudo to execute\narbitrary commands as the 'root' user. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned the name CVE-2005-3629 to\nthis issue.\nThe following issues have also been fixed in this update:\n* extraneous characters were logged on bootup\n* fsck was attempted on file systems marked with _netdev in rc.sysinit\nbefore they were available\n* the dynamically-linked /sbin/multipath was called instead of the correct\n/sbin/multiplath.static\nAdditionally, this update includes support for partitioned multipath\ndevices and a technology preview of static IP over InifiniBand.\nAll users of initscripts should upgrade to this updated package, which\nresolves these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
