Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003:006"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Important","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated libpng packages are available that fix a buffer overflow vulnerability.\n[Updated 15 Jan 2003]\nAdvisory updated to include libpng10 packages for Red Hat Linux 8.0. \nlibpng10 contains compatibility libraries used to run binaries that were\nlinked dynamically with libpng 1.0.x.","The libpng package contains a library of functions for creating and\nmanipulating PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image format files. PNG\nis a bit-mapped graphics format similar to the GIF format. \nUnpatched versions of libpng 1.2.1 and earlier do not correctly calculate\noffsets, which leads to a buffer overflow and the possibility of arbitrary\ncode execution.  This could be exploited by an attacker creating a\ncarefully crafted PNG file which could execute arbitrary code when the\nvictim views it.\nPackages within Red Hat Linux, such as Mozilla, make use of the shared\nlibpng library. Therefore, all users are advised to upgrade to the errata\npackages.  For Red Hat Linux 8.0 the packages contain libpng 1.2.2 which is\nnot vulnerable to this issue.  For Red Hat Linux 6.2, 7, 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3\nthe packages contain libpng 1.0.14 with a backported patch that corrects\nthis issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
