When mounting a directory, rpc.mountd could\ncrash if the reverse lookup of the client in DNS failed to match the\nforward lookup.  An attacker who has the ability to mount remote\ndirectories from a server could make use of this flaw to cause a denial of\nservice by making rpc.mountd crash.\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nnfs-utils 1.0.6 and is not vulnerable to this issue.\nNOTE: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 includes a version of rpc.mountd that is\nnot vulnerable to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
