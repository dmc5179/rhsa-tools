This could allow an attacker\nto cause a denial of service. (CVE-2008-3526, Important)\nA deficiency was found in the Linux kernel Stream Control Transmission\nProtocol (SCTP) Authentication Extension implementation. All the SCTP-AUTH\nsocket options could cause a kernel panic if the API was used when the\nextension is disabled. (CVE-2008-3792, Important)\nMissing boundary checks were reported in the Linux kernel SCTP\nimplementation. This could, potentially, cause information disclosure via a\nspecially crafted SCTP_HMAC_IDENT IOCTL request. (CVE-2008-4113,\nCVE-2008-4445, Important)\nTobias Klein reported a missing check in the Linux kernel's Open Sound\nSystem (OSS) implementation. This deficiency could lead to a possible\ninformation leak. (CVE-2008-3272, Moderate)\nA deficiency was found in the Linux kernel virtual filesystem (VFS)\nimplementation. This could allow a local unprivileged user to make a series\nof file creations within deleted directories, possibly causing a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2008-3275, Moderate)\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel Network File System daemon (nfsd) when\nNFSv4 was enabled. Remote attackers could use this to cause a denial of\nservice via a buffer overflow. (CVE-2008-3915, Moderate)\nA possible integer overflow was discovered in the Linux kernel Datagram\nCongestion Control Protocol (DCCP) implementation. This could allow a\nremote attacker to cause a denial of service on a victim's machine.\n(CVE-2008-3276, Low)\nA deficiency was found in the Linux kernel tmpfs implementation. This could\nallow a local unprivileged user to make a certain sequence of file\noperations, possibly causing a denial of service. (CVE-2008-3534, Low)\nAn off-by-one error was found in the iov_iter_advance function. This could\nallow a local unprivileged user to cause a denial of service as\ndemonstrated by a testcase from the Linux Test Project. (CVE-2008-3535,\nLow)\nThese updated packages also fix the following bugs:\n* fixed a warning in the openib code.\n* increased MAX_STACK_TRACE_ENTRIES on the debug kernel variant.\n* enqueue deprioritized RT tasks to head of prio array.\n* use timer_pending() to test ipv6 FIB timers.\n* added a lower-bound check for the length field in PPPOE headers.\n* pppoe: unshare skb to avoid possible data loss.\n* using growisofs could cause oops due to the lack of proper sanity checks.\n* random seed improvement.\n* enabled the \"Panic on Oops\" feature.\n* fixed a portability issue in parse_pmtmr() due to variable type.\n* fixed sanity check in cifs/asn1.c.\n* fixed a bug introduced by a previous fix, related to the inode code.\n* added better sanity checks to dlm code.\n* dynamic ftrace enhancements. The daemon is no longer used.\n* fixed a format string bug in cpufreq.\n* avoid a potential kernel stack overflow in binfmt_misc.c\n* fixed the long boot-up time when CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING is enabled.\n* use a better random seed for NAT port randomization.\n* a compat_semaphore was being handled as a regular semaphore due to\ncasting (qla2xxx driver).\nAll users of Red Hat Enterprise MRG should upgrade to these new packages,\nwhich address these vulnerabilities and fix these bugs.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
