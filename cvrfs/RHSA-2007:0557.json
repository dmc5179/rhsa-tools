On sites\nwhere the server-status page is publicly accessible and ExtendedStatus is\nenabled, this flaw could lead to a cross-site scripting attack. On Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux, the server-status page is not enabled by default and it\nis best practice to not make this publicly available. (CVE-2006-5752)\nA bug was found in the Apache HTTP Server mod_cache module. On sites where\ncaching is enabled, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted\nrequest that would cause the Apache child process handling that request to\ncrash. This could lead to a denial of service if using a threaded\nMulti-Processing Module. (CVE-2007-1863)\nThe Apache HTTP Server did not verify that a process was an Apache child\nprocess before sending it signals. A local attacker with the ability to run\nscripts on the Apache HTTP Server could manipulate the scoreboard and cause\narbitrary processes to be terminated which could lead to a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2007-3304).\nUsers of httpd should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues. Users should restart Apache\nafter installing this update.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
