If the configured tftp-root\nis sufficiently long, and a remote user sends a request that sends a long\nfile name, dnsmasq could crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with\nthe privileges of the dnsmasq service (usually the unprivileged \"nobody\"\nuser). (CVE-2009-2957)\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was discovered in dnsmasq when the TFTP\nservice is enabled. This flaw could allow a malicious TFTP client to crash\nthe dnsmasq service. (CVE-2009-2958)\nNote: The default tftp-root is \"/var/ftpd\", which is short enough to make\nit difficult to exploit the CVE-2009-2957 issue; if a longer directory name\nis used, arbitrary code execution may be possible. As well, the dnsmasq\npackage distributed by Red Hat does not have TFTP support enabled by\ndefault.\nAll users of dnsmasq should upgrade to this updated package, which contains\na backported patch to correct these issues. After installing the updated\npackage, the dnsmasq service must be restarted for the update to take\neffect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
