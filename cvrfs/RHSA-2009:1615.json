A Document Type Definition (DTD) defines the\nlegal syntax (and also which elements can be used) for certain types of\nfiles, such as XML files.\nA flaw was found in the way the Apache Xerces2 Java Parser processed the\nSYSTEM identifier in DTDs. A remote attacker could provide a\nspecially-crafted XML file, which once parsed by an application using the\nApache Xerces2 Java Parser, would lead to a denial of service (application\nhang due to excessive CPU use). (CVE-2009-2625)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a backported\npatch to correct this issue. Applications using the Apache Xerces2 Java\nParser must be restarted for this update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
