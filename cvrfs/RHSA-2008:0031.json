We have updated the\npackages to correct this bug.","X.Org is an open source implementation of the X Window System. It provides\nbasic low-level functionality that full-fledged graphical user interfaces\nare designed upon.\nTwo integer overflow flaws were found in the X.Org server's EVI and MIT-SHM\nmodules. A malicious authorized client could exploit these issues to cause\na denial of service (crash), or potentially execute arbitrary code with\nroot privileges on the X.Org server. (CVE-2007-6429)\nA memory corruption flaw was found in the X.Org server's XInput extension.\nA malicious authorized client could exploit this issue to cause a denial of\nservice (crash), or potentially execute arbitrary code with root privileges\non the X.Org server. (CVE-2007-6427)\nAn input validation flaw was found in the X.Org server's XFree86-Misc\nextension. A malicious authorized client could exploit this issue to cause\na denial of service (crash), or potentially execute arbitrary code with\nroot privileges on the X.Org server. (CVE-2007-5760)\nAn information disclosure flaw was found in the X.Org server's TOG-CUP\nextension. A malicious authorized client could exploit this issue to cause\na denial of service (crash), or potentially view arbitrary memory content\nwithin the X server's address space. (CVE-2007-6428)\nA flaw was found in the X.Org server's XC-SECURITY extension, that could\nhave allowed a local user to verify the existence of an arbitrary file,\neven in directories that are not normally accessible to that user.\n(CVE-2007-5958)\nUsers of xorg-x11-server should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
