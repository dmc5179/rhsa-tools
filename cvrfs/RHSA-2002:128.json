When running enterprise\nkernels previous to version 2.4.9-e.8, information in the Intel SSE XMM\nregisters could \"leak\" between processes under certain circumstances.\nThis update also includes fixes for the following bugs:\n- Creation of an Oracle SGA greater than 8 GB on 16 GB or greater machine\nwhen using bigpages and shmfs \n- Sendmail running out of flocks\n- Unreliable rebooting with the \"reboot=bios\" boot option\n- Potential memory corruption on systems with more than 4 GB \n- An AIO write deadlock \n- IOAPIC warnings on one platform \n- Potentially miscompiled code in xor.h (though kernel engineering\nresearch does not indicate that our compiler miscompiles this code)\nThis kernel also has extra exported symbols removed.\nThis new kernel also includes several updated device drivers. The\naic7xxx_mod driver has been updated to a new version, fixing several\nbugs, the tg3 driver has also been updated to a new version to fix various\nbugs, and the qla2300 driver has some small bug fixes and has been updated\nto work with the QLogic 2340 HBA and PowerVault 660F arrays.
