A remote attacker who is able to connect to a\nJSSE-based service could trigger this flaw leading to a denial-of-service.\n(CVE-2007-3698) \nA flaw was found in the way the Java Runtime Environment processes font\ndata. An untrusted applet could elevate its privileges, allowing the applet\nto perform actions with the same permissions as the logged in user. It may\nalso be possible to crash a server application which processes untrusted\nfont information from a third party. (CVE-2007-4381) \nThe applet caching mechanism of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) did not\ncorrectly process the creation of network connections. A remote attacker\ncould use this flaw to create connections to services on machines other\nthan the one that the applet was downloaded from. (CVE-2007-5232)\nMultiple vulnerabilities existed in Java Web Start allowing an untrusted\napplication to determine the location of the Java Web Start cache.\n(CVE-2007-5238)\nUntrusted Java Web Start Applications or Java Applets were able to drag and\ndrop a file to a Desktop Application. A user-assisted remote attacker could\nuse this flaw to move or copy arbitrary files. (CVE-2007-5239)\nThe Java Runtime Environment allowed untrusted Java Applets or applications\nto display oversized Windows. This could be used by remote attackers to\nhide security warning banners. (CVE-2007-5240)\nUnsigned Java Applets communicating via a HTTP proxy could allow a remote\nattacker to violate the Java security model. A cached malicious Applet\ncould create network connections to services on other machines.\n(CVE-2007-5273)\nUnsigned Applets loaded with Mozilla Firefox or Opera browsers allowed\nremote attackers to violate the Java security model. A cached malicious\nApplet could create network connections to services on other machines.\n(CVE-2007-5274)\nAll users of java-1.4.2-ibm are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, that contain IBM's 1.4.2 SR10 Java release which resolves these\nissues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
