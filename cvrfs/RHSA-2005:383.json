Perepelitsa discovered a bug in the way Firefox handles\nanonymous functions during regular expression string replacement. It is\npossible for a malicious web page to capture a random block of browser\nmemory. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\nhas assigned the name CAN-2005-0989 to this issue.\nOmar Khan discovered a bug in the way Firefox processes the PLUGINSPAGE\ntag. It is possible for a malicious web page to trick a user into pressing\nthe \"manual install\" button for an unknown plugin leading to arbitrary\njavascript code execution. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0752 to this issue.\nDoron Rosenberg discovered a bug in the way Firefox displays pop-up\nwindows. If a user choses to open a pop-up window whose URL is malicious\njavascript, the script will be executed with elevated privileges. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2005-1153 to this issue.\nA bug was found in the way Firefox handles the javascript global scope for\na window. It is possible for a malicious web page to define a global\nvariable known to be used by a different site, allowing malicious code to\nbe executed in the context of the site. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-1154 to\nthis issue.\nMichael Krax discovered a bug in the way Firefox handles favicon links. A\nmalicious web page can programatically define a favicon link tag as\njavascript, executing arbitrary javascript with elevated privileges. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2005-1155 to this issue.\nMichael Krax discovered a bug in the way Firefox installed search plugins.\nIf a user chooses to install a search plugin from a malicious site, the new\nplugin could silently overwrite an existing plugin. This could allow the\nmalicious plugin to execute arbitrary code and steal sensitive information.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the names CAN-2005-1156 and CAN-2005-1157 to these issues. \nKohei Yoshino discovered a bug in the way Firefox opens links in its\nsidebar. A malicious web page could construct a link in such a way that,\nwhen clicked on, could execute arbitrary javascript with elevated\nprivileges. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-1158 to this issue.\nA bug was found in the way Firefox validated several XPInstall related\njavascript objects. A malicious web page could pass other objects to the\nXPInstall objects, resulting in the javascript interpreter jumping to\narbitrary locations in memory. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-1159 to this issue.\nA bug was found in the way the Firefox privileged UI code handled DOM nodes\nfrom the content window. A malicious web page could install malicious\njavascript code or steal data requiring a user to do commonplace actions\nsuch as clicking a link or opening the context menu. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2005-1160 to this issue.\nUsers of Firefox are advised to upgrade to this updated package which\ncontains Firefox version 1.0.3 and is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
