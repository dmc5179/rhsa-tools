Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of\nup2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be\ndownloaded directly from the RHN website:\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2004:159"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Important","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated Subversion packages that fix a vulnerability in neon, exploitable by\na malicious DAV server, are now available.","Subversion is a concurrent version control system that uses inbuilt code\nfrom neon, an HTTP and WebDAV client library.\nVersions of the neon client library up to and including 0.24.4 have been\nfound to contain a number of format string bugs.  An attacker could create\na malicious WebDAV server in such a way as to allow arbitrary code\nexecution on the client should a user connect to it using subversion.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2004-0179 to this issue.\nThis update includes a patch to correct this issue, and an upgrade to\nSubversion 0.27.0, the last version which is compatible with the database\nschema used by Subversion 0.17.0.  Users of Subversion are advised to\nupgrade to these updated packages.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
