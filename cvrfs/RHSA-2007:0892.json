A remote unauthenticated\nattacker who can access kadmind could trigger this flaw and cause kadmind\nto crash.  On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 it is not possible to exploit this\nflaw to run arbitrary code as the overflow is blocked by FORTIFY_SOURCE.\n(CVE-2007-4743)\nThis issue did not affect the versions of Kerberos distributed with Red\nHat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, or 4.\nUsers of krb5-server are advised to update to these erratum packages which\ncontain a corrected backported fix for this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
