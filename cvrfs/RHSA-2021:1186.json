A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.","The ovirt-engine package provides the manager for virtualization environments.\nThis manager enables admins to define hosts and networks, as well as to add\nstorage, create VMs and manage user permissions.\nBug Fix(es):\n* Previously, saving user preferences in the Red Hat Virtualization Manager required the MANIPULATE_USERS permission level. As a result, user preferences were not saved on the server.\nIn this release, the required permission level for saving user preferences was changed to EDIT_PROFILE, which is the permission level assigned by default to all users. As a result, saving user preferences works as expected.
