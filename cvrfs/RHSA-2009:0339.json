An attacker could use these flaws to create a\nspecially-crafted image file which could cause an application using\nLittleCMS to crash, or, possibly, execute arbitrary code when opened by a\nvictim. (CVE-2009-0723, CVE-2009-0733)\nA memory leak flaw was found in LittleCMS. An application using LittleCMS\ncould use excessive amount of memory, and possibly crash after using all\navailable memory, if used to open specially-crafted images. (CVE-2009-0581)\nRed Hat would like to thank Chris Evans from the Google Security Team for\nreporting these issues.\nAll users of LittleCMS should install these updated packages, which upgrade\nLittleCMS to version 1.18. All running applications using the lcms library\nmust be restarted for the update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
