A local user\ncould utilize these flaws to overwrite files via a symlink attack on\ntemporary files.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0968 and CAN-2004-1382 to\nthese issues.\nIt was discovered that the use of LD_DEBUG and LD_SHOW_AUXV were not\nrestricted for a setuid program.  A local user could utilize this flaw to\ngain information, such as the list of symbols used by the program.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name  CAN-2004-1453 to this issue.\nThis erratum also addresses the following bugs in the GNU C Library:\n- Now avoids calling sigaction (SIGPIPE, ...) in syslog implementation\n- Fixed poll on Itanium\n- Now allows setenv/putenv in shared library constructors\nUsers of glibc are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages that remove\nthe unecessary glibcbug script and contain backported patches to correct\nthese other issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
