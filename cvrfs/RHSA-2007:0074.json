A carefully crafted mail message could cause SpamAssassin to consume\nsignificant resources. If a number of these messages are sent, this could\nlead to a denial of service, potentially delaying or preventing the\ndelivery  of email.\n(CVE-2007-0451)\nUsers of SpamAssassin should upgrade to these updated packages which\ncontain version 3.1.8 which is not vulnerable to these issues.  \nThis is an upgrade from SpamAssassin version 3.0.6 to 3.1.8, which contains\nmany bug fixes and spam detection enhancements. Further details are\navailable in the SpamAssassin 3.1 changelog and upgrade guide.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
