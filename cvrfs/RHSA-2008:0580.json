If Vim looked up a document's maliciously crafted tag or keyword,\nit was possible to execute arbitrary code as the user running Vim.\n(CVE-2008-4101)\nMultiple security flaws were found in netrw.vim, the Vim plug-in providing\nfile reading and writing over the network. If a user opened a specially\ncrafted file or directory with the netrw plug-in, it could result in\narbitrary code execution as the user running Vim. (CVE-2008-3076)\nA security flaw was found in zip.vim, the Vim plug-in that handles ZIP\narchive browsing. If a user opened a ZIP archive using the zip.vim plug-in,\nit could result in arbitrary code execution as the user running Vim.\n(CVE-2008-3075)\nA security flaw was found in tar.vim, the Vim plug-in which handles TAR\narchive browsing. If a user opened a TAR archive using the tar.vim plug-in,\nit could result in arbitrary code execution as the user runnin Vim.\n(CVE-2008-3074)\nSeveral input sanitization flaws were found in various Vim system\nfunctions. If a user opened a specially crafted file, it was possible to\nexecute arbitrary code as the user running Vim. (CVE-2008-2712)\nUlf HÃ¤rnhammar, of Secunia Research, discovered a format string flaw in\nVim's help tag processor. If a user was tricked into executing the\n\"helptags\" command on malicious data, arbitrary code could be executed with\nthe permissions of the user running Vim. (CVE-2007-2953)\nAll Vim users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
