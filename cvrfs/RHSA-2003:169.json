Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.

It can decode and encode\nmultilingual streams through many coding systems, such as ISO-8859,\nISO-2022, EUC, SJIS Big5, HZ, and Unicode.\nA bug has been found in versions of lv that read a .lv file in the current\ndirectory.  Local attackers can use this to place an .lv file in any\ndirectory to which they have write access.  Any user who subsequently runs\nlv in that directory and uses the v (edit) command can be forced to execute\nan arbitrary program.\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain a\nversion of lv that is patched to read the .lv configuration file only in\nthe user's home directory.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
