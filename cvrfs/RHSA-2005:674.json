If a local user has write permissions to a\nsubdirectory within the tree being removed by File::Path::rmtree, it is\npossible for them to create setuid binary files. The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0448\nto this issue.    \nThis update also addresses the following issues:\n-- Perl interpreter caused a segmentation fault when environment    \nchanges occurred during runtime.\n-- Code in lib/FindBin contained a regression that caused problems with  \nMRTG software package.\n-- Perl incorrectly declared it provides an FCGI interface where it in fact\ndid not.    \nUsers of Perl are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which \ncontain backported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
