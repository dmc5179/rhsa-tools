These updates fix a bug in handling of restricted keys which may\nallow users to bypass command restrictions by using subsystems and a subtle\nbug which might aid a passive analysis attack.","OpenSSH versions prior to 2.9.9, when configured to provide sftp access\nusing the subsystem feature, allows remote authenticated users to bypass\nauthorized_keys2 \"command=\" restrictions by using sftp commands.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2001-0816 to this issue.\nOpenSSH 2.9 also contained a subtle bug in the routines which attempt to\nconfound an attacker using passive analysis, which would cause it to send\ntwo confounding packets instead of one when a client finished sending it a\npassword.\nRed Hat would like to thank Solar Designer and Markus Friedl for assisting\nwith the patches.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
