CUPS contained a copy of the Xpdf code\nused for parsing PDF files and was therefore affected by these bugs.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned the\nname CAN-2004-0888 to this issue, and Red Hat released erratum\nRHSA-2004:543 with updated packages.\nIt was found that the patch used to correct this issue was not sufficient\nand did not fully protect CUPS running on 64-bit architectures.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2005-0206 to this issue. \nThese updated packages also include a fix that prevents the CUPS\ninitscript from being accidentally replaced.\nAll users of CUPS on 64-bit architectures should upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain a corrected patch and are not vulnerable to these\nissues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
