GNU TLS includes Libtasn1, a library developed for\nASN.1 structures management that includes DER encoding and decoding.\nSeveral flaws were found in the way libtasn1 decodes DER.  An attacker\ncould create a carefully crafted invalid X.509 certificate in such a way\nthat could trigger this flaw if parsed by an application that uses GNU TLS.\nThis could lead to a denial of service (application crash).  It is not\ncertain if this issue could be escalated to allow arbitrary code execution. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the name\nCVE-2006-0645 to this issue.\nIn Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, the GNU TLS library is only used by the\nEvolution client when connecting to an Exchange server or when publishing\ncalendar information to a WebDAV server.\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a\nbackported patch from the GNU TLS maintainers to correct this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
