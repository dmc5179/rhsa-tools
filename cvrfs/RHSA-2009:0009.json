This could allow a local, unprivileged user to prepare\nand run a specially-crafted binary which would use this deficiency to leak\nuninitialized and potentially sensitive data. (CVE-2008-0598, Important)\n* Olaf Kirch reported a flaw in the i915 kernel driver that only affects\nthe Intel G33 series and newer. This flaw could, potentially, lead to local\nprivilege escalation. (CVE-2008-3831, Important)\n* Miklos Szeredi reported a missing check for files opened with O_APPEND in\nsys_splice(). This could allow a local, unprivileged user to bypass the\nappend-only file restrictions. (CVE-2008-4554, Important)\n* a deficiency was found in the Linux kernel Stream Control Transmission\nProtocol (SCTP) implementation. This could lead to a possible denial of\nservice if one end of a SCTP connection did not support the AUTH extension.\n(CVE-2008-4576, Important)\n* Wei Yongjun reported a flaw in the Linux kernel SCTP implementation. In\ncertain code paths, sctp_sf_violation_paramlen() could be called with a\nwrong parameter data type. This could lead to a possible denial of service.\n(CVE-2008-4618, Important)\n* when fput() was called to close a socket, the __scm_destroy() function in\nthe Linux kernel could make indirect recursive calls to itself. This could,\npotentially, lead to a denial of service issue. (CVE-2008-5029, Important)\n* the ext2 and ext3 filesystem code failed to properly handle corrupted\ndata structures, leading to a possible local denial of service issue when\nread or write operations were performed. (CVE-2008-3528, Low)\nThese updated packages also address numerous bugs, including the following:\n* several System on Chip (SoC) audio drivers allocated memory in the\nplatform device probe function but did not free this memory in the event of\nan error. Instead, the memory was freed in the device probe function's\nerror path. This could result in a 'double free' error. With this update,\nerrors cause memory to be freed correctly.\n* when a check was made to see if the netlink attribute fitted into\navailable memory, the value returned, \"remaining\", could become negative\ndue to alignment in nla_next(). GCC set \"remaining\" to unsigned when\ntesting against the sizeof(*nla), however. As a consequence, the test would\nalways succeed and the function nla_for_each_attr() could, potentially,\naccess memory outside the received buffer. With this update, sizeof is cast\nto an integer, ensuring sizeof(*nla) does a signed test and prevents an\nillegal memory de-reference.\n* if a user-space process used a SIGIO notification and did not disable it\nbefore closing the file descriptor, a stale pointer was left in the\nasync_queue of the real-time clock. When a different user-space process\nsubsequently used a SIGIO notification, the kernel de-referenced this\npointer and crashed. With this updated kernel, SIGIO notifications are\ndisabled when the file descriptor is closed, preventing this.\n* the real-time kernel included with Red Hat Enterprise Linux MRG did not\nrandomize exec, heap or libc addresses. This update corrects this omission:\nexec, heap and libc addresses are now randomized.\nNumerous other bug fixes included with this update are noted in the Red Hat\nEnterprise MRG 1.0 Real Time Security Update Release Note, available at the\nlocation noted in the References section below.\nAll Red Hat Enterprise MRG users should install this update which addresses\nthese vulnerabilities and fixes these bugs.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
