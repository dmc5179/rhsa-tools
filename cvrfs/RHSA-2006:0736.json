If a PHP script used the vulnerable\nfunctions to parse UTF-8 data, a remote attacker sending a carefully\ncrafted request could trigger the overflow and potentially execute\narbitrary code as the 'apache' user. (CVE-2006-5465) \nA response-splitting issue was discovered in the PHP session handling. If\na remote attacker can force a carefully crafted session identifier to be\nused, a cross-site-scripting or response-splitting attack could be\npossible. (CVE-2006-3016)\nA buffer overflow was discovered found in the PHP sscanf() function. If a\nscript used the sscanf() function with positional arguments in the format\nstring, a remote attacker sending a carefully crafted request could execute\narbitrary code as the 'apache' user. (CVE-2006-4020)\nUsers of Stronghold should upgrade to these updated packages which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
