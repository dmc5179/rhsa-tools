The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2001-1267 and CAN-2001-1268 to\nthis issue. \nIn addition, unzip version 5.42 and earlier also allows attackers to\noverwrite arbitrary files during archive extraction via filenames in the\narchive that begin with the \"/\" (slash) character. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2001-1269 to this issue.\nDuring testing of the fix to GNU tar, it was discovered that GNU tar\n1.13.25 was still vulnerable to a modified version of the same problem. Red\nHat has provided a patch to tar 1.3.25 to correct this problem. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2002-0399 to this issue.\nGNU tar 1.13.19 and other versions before 1.13.25 allow remote attackers\nto overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack, as the result of a\nmodification that effectively disabled the security check.  This issue\naffects only Red Hat Linux 7.1 and 7.2.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-1216 to\nthis issue.\nUsers of unzip and tar are advised to upgrade to these errata packages,\ncontaining unzip version 5.50 (for Red Hat Linux 6.2, 7, 7.1, and 7.2) and\na patched version of GNU tar 1.13.25 (for Red Hat Linux 6.2, 7, 7.1, 7.2,\nand 7.3), which are not vulnerable to these issues.\nImportant Note: For users of Red Hat Linux 6.2 and 7 only, these errata\npackages change one of the command line options for tar.  Previously the\n'-I' option was used to enable bzip2 compression, while in these errata\npackages the option has changed to '-j'.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
