On a system where Ethereal is running, a remote\nattacker could send malicious packets that could cause Ethereal to crash or\nexecute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0507 to this issue.\nIn addition, other flaws in Ethereal prior to 0.10.4 were found that could\ncause it to crash in response to carefully crafted SIP (CAN-2004-0504), AIM\n(CAN-2004-0505), or SPNEGO (CAN-2004-0506) packets.\nUsers of Ethereal should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported security patches that correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
