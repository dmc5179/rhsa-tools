When XSane creates temporary files, it\ndoes so with predictable filenames in a manner that would follow symbolic\nlinks.  This could allow a local user to overwrite files \nwritten by the user running XSane.  \nAdditionally, the SANE library that XSane uses also has some similar \nproblems. When some SANE backend drivers created temporary files they \ndid so in a manner that would follow symbolic links. These packages \nprevent that kind of attack. The default configuration had one of these \nbackends enabled. These packages update XSane to version 0.82 and turn off\nthe vulnerable backend in the default configuration.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the names CAN-2001-0887 and CAN-2001-0890 to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
