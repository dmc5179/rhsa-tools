The ACL plug-in treated negative\naccess rights as positive rights, which could allow an attacker to bypass\nintended access restrictions. (CVE-2008-4577)\nA password disclosure flaw was found with Dovecot's configuration file. If\na system had the \"ssl_key_password\" option defined, any local user could\nview the SSL key password. (CVE-2008-4870)\nNote: This flaw did not allow the attacker to acquire the contents of the\nSSL key. The password has no value without the key file which arbitrary\nusers should not have read access to.\nTo better protect even this value, however, the dovecot.conf file now\nsupports the \"!include_try\" directive. The ssl_key_password option should\nbe moved from dovecot.conf to a new file owned by, and only readable and\nwritable by, root (ie 0600). This file should be referenced from\ndovecot.conf by setting the \"!include_try [/path/to/password/file]\" option.\nAdditionally, this update addresses the following bugs:\n* the dovecot init script -- /etc/rc.d/init.d/dovecot -- did not check if\nthe dovecot binary or configuration files existed. It also used the wrong\npid file for checking the dovecot service's status. This update includes a\nnew init script that corrects these errors.\n* the %files section of the dovecot spec file did not include \"%dir\n%{ssldir}/private\". As a consequence, the /etc/pki/private/ directory was\nnot owned by dovecot. (Note: files inside /etc/pki/private/ were and are\nowned by dovecot.) With this update, the missing line has been added to the\nspec file, and the noted directory is now owned by dovecot.\n* in some previously released versions of dovecot, the authentication\nprocess accepted (and passed along un-escaped) passwords containing\ncharacters that had special meaning to dovecot's internal protocols. This\nupdated release prevents such passwords from being passed back, instead\nreturning the error, \"Attempted login with password having illegal chars\".\nNote: dovecot versions previously shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5\ndid not allow this behavior. This update addresses the issue above but said\nissue was only present in versions of dovecot not previously included with\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\nUsers of dovecot are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\naddresses these vulnerabilities and resolves these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
