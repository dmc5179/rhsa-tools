This flaw could cause server\napplications that call those functions during reload, such as a combination\nof the Apache HTTP Server, mod_ssl, PHP, and cURL, to consume all available\nmemory, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2009-4355)\nDan Kaminsky found that browsers could accept certificates with MD2 hash\nsignatures, even though MD2 is no longer considered a cryptographically\nstrong algorithm. This could make it easier for an attacker to create a\nmalicious certificate that would be treated as trusted by a browser.\nOpenSSL now disables the use of the MD2 algorithm inside signatures by\ndefault. (CVE-2009-2409)\nAll OpenSSL users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues. For the update to take effect,\nall services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system\nrebooted.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
