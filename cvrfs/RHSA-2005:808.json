Video drivers, which sometimes map kernel pages with a different\ncaching policy than write-back, are now expected to function correctly. \nThis change affects the x86, AMD64, and Intel EM64T architectures.\nIn addition the following security bugs were fixed:\nThe set_mempolicy system call did not check for negative numbers in the\npolicy field.  An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to cause a\ndenial of service (system panic).  (CVE-2005-3053)\nA flaw in ioremap handling on AMD 64 and Intel EM64T systems.  An\nunprivileged local user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or\nminor information leak. (CVE-2005-3108)\nA race condition in the ebtables netfilter module.  On a SMP system that is\noperating under a heavy load this flaw may allow remote attackers to cause\na denial of service (crash).  (CVE-2005-3110)\nA memory leak was found in key handling.  An unprivileged local user could\nuse this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2005-3119)\nA flaw in the Orinoco wireless driver.  On systems running the vulnerable\ndrive, a remote attacker could send carefully crafted packets which would\ndivulge the contents of uninitialized kernel memory.  (CVE-2005-3180)\nA memory leak was found in the audit system.  An unprivileged local user\ncould use this flaw to cause a denial of service.  (CVE-2005-3181)\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users are advised to upgrade their kernels\nto the packages associated with their machine architectures and\nconfigurations as listed in this erratum.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
