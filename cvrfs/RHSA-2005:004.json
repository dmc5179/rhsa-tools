A vulnerable version of this library was found within\nLesstif. An attacker could create a carefully crafted XPM file which would\ncause an application to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code if\nopened by a victim.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CAN-2004-0687,CAN-2004-0688, and\nCAN-2004-0914 to these issues.\nUsers of LessTif are advised to upgrade to this erratum package, which\ncontains backported security patches to the embedded libXpm library.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
