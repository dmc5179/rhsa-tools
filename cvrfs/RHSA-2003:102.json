Applications making\nuse of OpenSSL are generally vulnerable to such an attack, unless RSA\nblinding has been turned on. OpenSSL does not use RSA blinding by default\nand most applications do not enable RSA blinding.\nA local or remote attacker could use this attack to obtain the server's\nprivate key by determining factors using timing differences on (1) the\nnumber of extra reductions during Montgomery reduction, and (2) the use of\ndifferent integer multiplication algorithms (Karatsuba and normal).\nIn order for an attack to be sucessful, an attacker must have good\nnetwork conditions that allow small changes in timing to be reliably\nobserved.\nAdditionally, the SSL and TLS components for OpenSSL allow remote attackers\nto perform an unauthorized RSA private key operation via a modified\nBleichenbacher attack. This attack (also known as the Klima-Pokorny-Rosa\nattack) uses a large number of SSL or TLS connections using PKCS #1 v1.5\npadding to cause OpenSSL to leak information regarding the relationship\nbetween ciphertext and the associated plaintext.\nThese erratum packages contain a patch provided by the OpenSSL group that\nenables RSA blinding by default, and protects against the\nKlima-Pokorny-Rosa attack.\nBecause server applications are affected by these vulnerabilities, we\nadvise users to restart all services that use OpenSSL functionality or,\nalternatively, reboot their systems after installing these updates.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
