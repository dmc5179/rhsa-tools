These \ncredentials should only be accessible to administrative and service users. \nA local user could use this flaw to read Red Hat Certificate System \nconfiguration files containing sensitive information. (CVE-2008-2367)\nIt was discovered that Red Hat Certificate System stored plain text\npasswords in multiple debug log files with insufficient access restrictions\n(such as the UserDirEnrollment log and RA wizard installer log). A local\nuser could use this flaw to extract plain text passwords from the Red Hat\nCertificate System debug log files. (CVE-2008-2368)\nThese updated packages fix the following bugs:\n* Due to a regression, signing a certificate revocation list (CRL) with\napproximately 150,000 records may have taken up to five minutes. In these\nupdated packages, signing such CRLs takes approximately twenty seconds.\n* Because Certificate System servers could not handle Online Certificate \nStatus Protocol (OCSP) requests in the GET method, OCSP GET requests \nresulted in a 404 error. The bug for handling GET requests may have also \ncaused a system to use 100% CPU. This has been resolved. Additionally, \nOCSP requests are now logged to the debug log file.\n* It was possible for a CRL update to run at the same time as a certificate\nstatus update. Now, CRL updating locks out the certificate status update\nthread.\n* Inefficient LDAP search methods caused LDAP searches for 100,000 or \nmore revoked certificates to take twenty minutes or longer during CRL \ngeneration. The LDAP search method has been modified to greatly improve \nLDAP search times.\n* The default OCSP verification path has changed since Red Hat Certificate\nSystem 7.1. These updated packages add support for certificates that use\nthe old AuthorityInfoAccess (AIA) URL.\n* An OCSP client submitting an OCSP request via the GET method may have \ncaused a NullPointerException.\n* If an agent automatically approved a certificate signing request (CSR),\nusing AgentCertAuth, the resultant certificate contained blank \nsubjectAltName extension fields. A manual enrollment by the same agent \nproduced a certificate with the correct number of subjectAltNames and no \nblank entries. With this update, automated enrollments through \nAgentCertAuth do not have blank fields in issued certificates.\nAll users of Red Hat Certificate System 7.2 should upgrade to these updated\npackages, which resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
