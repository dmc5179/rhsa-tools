Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nAlso note that users of vipw may want to run (as root):\nchmod 0400 /etc/shadow\nto ensure that the file has the correct permissions.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2001:095"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Moderate","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["New util-linux packages are available for Red Hat Linux 7.1. These packages\nfix a problem where vipw would leave the /etc/shadow file world-readable\nafter editing it.\nIt is recommended that all users update to the fixed packages. Also, if you\nhave used vipw on Red Hat Linux 7.1 before, make sure to run (as root):\nchmod 0400 /etc/shadow","vipw, from the util-linux package in Red Hat Linux 7.1, included a new\noption that allowed editing of the /etc/shadow file as well as /etc/passwd.\nHowever, this option did not take measures to ensure that the file remained\nonly readable by root.\nThanks go to lloyd@acm.jhu.edu for bringing the problem to our attention.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
