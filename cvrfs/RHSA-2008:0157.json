The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is a\nstandard network protocol for remote printing, as well as managing print\njobs.\nA flaw was found in the way CUPS handles the addition and removal of remote\nshared printers via IPP. A remote attacker could send malicious UDP IPP\npackets causing the CUPS daemon to crash. (CVE-2008-0882)\nNote: the default configuration of CUPS on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 will\nonly accept requests of this type from the local subnet. This issue did not\naffect the versions of CUPS as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 or\n4.\nAll cups users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to resolve this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
