This erratum provides updated Apache and mod_ssl packages for\niSeries and pSeries that correct a number of security issues:\nVersions of the Apache Web server up to and including 1.3.24 contain a bug\nin the routines which deal with requests using \"chunked\" encoding.\nA carefully crafted invalid request can cause an Apache child process to\ncall the memcpy() function in a way that will write past the end of its\nbuffer, corrupting the stack. On some platforms this can be remotely\nexploited -- allowing arbitrary code to be run on the server. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2002-0392 to this issue.\nBuffer overflows in the ApacheBench support program (ab.c) in Apache\nversions prior to 1.3.27, and Apache versions 2.x prior to 2.0.43, allow a\nmalicious Web server to cause a denial of service (DoS) and possibly\nexecute arbitrary code via a long response. (CAN-2002-0843)\nTwo cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present in the error\npages for the default \"404 Not Found\" error and for the error response\nwhen a plain HTTP request is received on an SSL port. Both of these issues\nare only exploitable if the \"UseCanonicalName\" setting has been changed to\n\"Off\" and wildcard DNS is in use. These issues could allow remote\nattackers to execute scripts as other webpage visitors, for instance, to\nsteal cookies. These issues affect versions of Apache 1.3 before 1.3.26,\nversions of Apache 2.0 before 2.0.43, and versions of mod_ssl before\n2.8.12. (CAN-2002-0840, CAN-2002-1157)\nThe mod_ssl module provides strong cryptography for the Apache Web\nserver via the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security\n(TLS) protocols. Versions of mod_ssl prior to 2.8.10 are subject to a\nsingle NULL overflow that can cause arbitrary code execution.  (CAN-2002-0653)\nThe shared memory scoreboard in the HTTP daemon for Apache 1.3, prior to\nversion 1.3.27, allows a user running as the \"apache\" UID to send a\nSIGUSR1 signal to any process as root, resulting in a denial of service\n(process kill) or other such behavior that would not normally be allowed. \n(CAN-2002-0839). \nAfter the updated packages are installed, restart the httpd service by\nrunning the following command:\n/sbin/service httpd restart","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
