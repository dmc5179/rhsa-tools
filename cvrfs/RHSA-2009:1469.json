This driver allowed interfaces using this driver to\nreceive frames larger than what could be handled. This could lead to a\nremote denial of service or code execution. (CVE-2009-1389, Important)\n* Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes of the Google Security Team reported a\nflaw in the SOCKOPS_WRAP macro in the Linux kernel. This macro did not\ninitialize the sendpage operation in the proto_ops structure correctly. A\nlocal, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a local denial of\nservice or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2009-2692, Important)\n* Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes of the Google Security Team reported a\nflaw in the udp_sendmsg() implementation in the Linux kernel when using the\nMSG_MORE flag on UDP sockets. A local, unprivileged user could use this\nflaw to cause a local denial of service or escalate their privileges.\n(CVE-2009-2698, Important)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
