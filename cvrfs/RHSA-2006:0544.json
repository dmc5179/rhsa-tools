MySQL is a\nclient/server implementation consisting of a server daemon (mysqld) and\nmany different client programs and libraries.\nA flaw was found in the way the MySQL mysql_real_escape() function escaped\nstrings when operating in a multibyte character encoding.  An attacker\ncould provide an application a carefully crafted string containing\ninvalidly-encoded characters which may be improperly escaped, leading to\nthe injection of malicious SQL commands. (CVE-2006-2753)\nAn information disclosure flaw was found in the way the MySQL server\nprocessed malformed usernames. An attacker could view a small portion\nof server memory by supplying an anonymous login username which was not\nnull terminated. (CVE-2006-1516)\nAn information disclosure flaw was found in the way the MySQL server\nexecuted the COM_TABLE_DUMP command. An authenticated malicious user could\nsend a specially crafted packet to the MySQL server which returned\nrandom unallocated memory. (CVE-2006-1517)\nA log file obfuscation flaw was found in the way the mysql_real_query()\nfunction creates log file entries. An attacker with the the ability to call\nthe mysql_real_query() function against a mysql server can obfuscate the\nentry the server will write to the log file.  However, an attacker needed\nto have complete control over a server in order to attempt this attack.\n(CVE-2006-0903)\nThis update also fixes numerous non-security-related flaws, such as\nintermittent authentication failures.\nAll users of mysql are advised to upgrade to these updated packages\ncontaining MySQL version 4.1.20, which is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
