It is\npossible to cause PHP to consume CPU resources for a short period of time\nby supplying a carefully crafted IFF or JPEG image. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the\nnames CAN-2005-0524 and CAN-2005-0525 to these issues.\nA buffer overflow bug was also found in the way PHP processes EXIF image\nheaders. It is possible for an attacker to construct an image file in such\na way that it could execute arbitrary instructions when processed by PHP.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2005-1042 to this issue.\nA denial of service bug was found in the way PHP processes EXIF image\nheaders. It is possible for an attacker to cause PHP to enter an infinite\nloop for a short period of time by supplying a carefully crafted image file\nto PHP for processing. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-1043 to this issue.\nSeveral bug fixes are also included in this update:\n- The security fixes in RHSA-2004-687 to the \"unserializer\" code introduced\nsome performance issues.\n- In the gd extension, the \"imagecopymerge\" function did not correctly\nhandle transparency.  The original image was being obscured in the\nresultant image.\n- In the curl extension, safe mode was not enforced for 'file:///' URL\nlookups (CAN-2004-1392).\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported fixes for these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
