Various versions of the ISC BIND\nresolver libraries are vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.","ISC BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) is an implementation of the DNS \n(Domain Name System) protocols.  BIND includes a DNS server (named) --\nwhich resolves hostnames to IP addresses, a resolver library\n(routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS), and\nvarious tools.\nVersions of BIND 9 prior to 9.2.1 have a bug that causes certain requests\nto the BIND name server to fail an internal consistency check, causing the\nname server to stop responding to requests.  This can be used by a remote\nattacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) attack against name servers. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0400 to this issue.\nA buffer overflow vulnerability exists in multiple implementations of DNS\nresolver libraries. Applications that utilize vulnerable DNS resolver\nlibraries may be affected. A remote attacker who is able to send malicious\nDNS responses could potentially exploit this vulnerability to execute\narbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS) attack on a vulnerable\nsystem. Red Hat Linux does not ship with any applications or libraries that\nlink against the BIND resolver libraries; however, third party code may be\naffected. (CAN-2002-0651)\nRed Hat Linux Advanced Server shipped with a version of ISC BIND vulnerable\nto both of these issues.  All users of BIND are advised to upgrade to the\nerrata packages containing BIND 9.2.1 which contains backported patches\nthat correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
