A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.","The http-parser package provides a utility for parsing HTTP messages. It parses both requests and responses. The parser is designed to be used in performance HTTP applications. It does not make any system calls or allocations, it does not buffer data, and it can be interrupted at any time. Depending on your architecture, it only requires about 40 bytes of data per message stream.\nSecurity Fix(es):\n* nodejs: HTTP request smuggling using malformed Transfer-Encoding header (CVE-2019-15605)\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
