Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.","The libtiff packages contain a library of functions for manipulating Tagged\nImage File Format (TIFF) files.\nMultiple integer overflow flaws, leading to a buffer overflow, were\ndiscovered in libtiff. An attacker could use these flaws to create a\nspecially-crafted TIFF file that, when opened, would cause an application\nlinked against libtiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2010-1411)\nAn input validation flaw was discovered in libtiff. An attacker could use\nthis flaw to create a specially-crafted TIFF file that, when opened, would\ncause an application linked against libtiff to crash. (CVE-2010-2598)\nRed Hat would like to thank Apple Product Security for responsibly\nreporting the CVE-2010-1411 flaw, who credit Kevin Finisterre of\ndigitalmunition.com for the discovery of the issue.\nAll libtiff users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve these issues. All running\napplications linked against libtiff must be restarted for this update to\ntake effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
