These include potential leakage of information after SSL\nversion 3 key exchanges, imperfect distribution of random numbers used\nwhen generating signatures, honoring of sensitive environment variables\nin library functions in setuid or setgid applications, and not taking\nprecautions to counter effects of potential hardware glitches when\ngenerating digital signatures.\nA flaw has also been found in the pseudo-random number generator used\nin versions of OpenSSL prior to 0.9.6b.  The OpenSSL Project Team has\nreleased a patch which corrects this problem.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
