If a remote attacker could\nforce the PHP interpreter to allocate more memory than the memory_limit\nsetting before script execution begins, then the attacker may be\nable to supply the contents of a PHP hash table remotely.  This hash table\ncould then be used to execute arbitrary code as the 'apache' user.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2004-0594 to this issue.\nThis issue may be exploitable if using the default PHP configuration with\nthe \"register_globals\" setting of \"On\".  The Apache memory exhaustion bug,\nfixed in a previous update to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, may also allow\nthis PHP issue to be exploited; this Apache bug does not affect Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 2.1.\nStefan Esser discovered a flaw in the strip_tags function in versions of\nPHP before 4.3.8. The strip_tags function is commonly used by PHP scripts\nto prevent Cross-Site-Scripting attacks by removing HTML tags from\nuser-supplied form data. By embedding NUL bytes into form data, HTML tags\ncan in some cases be passed intact through the strip_tags function, which\nmay allow a Cross-Site-Scripting attack. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0595 to\nthis issue.\nAll users of PHP are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches that address these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
