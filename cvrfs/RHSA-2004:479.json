It\nprovides the basic low level functionality which full fledged graphical\nuser interfaces (GUIs) such as GNOME and KDE are designed upon.\nDuring a source code audit, Chris Evans discovered several stack overflow\nflaws and an integer overflow flaw in the X.Org libXpm library used to\ndecode XPM (X PixMap) images. An attacker could create a carefully crafted\nXPM file which would cause an application to crash or potentially execute\narbitrary code if opened by a victim. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CAN-2004-0687,\nCAN-2004-0688, and CAN-2004-0692 to these issues.\nThese packages also contain a bug fix to lower the RGB output voltage on\nDell servers using the ATI Radeon 7000m card.\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
