Several security issues have been found in the Ethereal packages\ndistributed with Red Hat Linux Advanced Server:\nBuffer overflow in Ethereal 0.9.5 and earlier allows remote attackers to\ncause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code via the ISIS dissector.\n(CAN-2002-0834) \nBuffer overflows in Ethereal 0.9.4 and earlier allows remote attackers\nto cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code via (1) the BGP\ndissector, or (2) the WCP dissector. (CAN-2002-0821)\nEthereal 0.9.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial\nof service and possibly excecute arbitrary code via the (1) SOCKS, (2)\nRSVP, (3) AFS, or (4) LMP dissectors, which can be caused to core\ndump (CAN-2002-0822)\nA buffer overflow in the X11 dissector in Ethereal before 0.9.4 allows\nremote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly\nexecute arbitrary code while Ethereal is parsing keysyms. (CAN-2002-0402)\nThe DNS dissector in Ethereal before 0.9.4 allows remote attackers to\ncause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a malformed packet\nthat causes Ethereal to enter an infinite loop. (CAN-2002-0403)\nA vulnerability in the GIOP dissector in Ethereal before 0.9.4 allows\nremote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).\n(CAN-2002-0404) \nUsers of Ethereal should update to the errata packages containing Ethereal\nversion 0.9.6 which is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
