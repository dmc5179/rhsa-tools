This could allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information,\nsuch as session IDs, for session hijacking attacks (CVE-2007-3382).\nIt was reported Tomcat did not properly handle the following character\nsequence in a cookie: \\\" (a backslash followed by a double-quote). It was\npossible remote attackers could use this failure to obtain sensitive\ninformation, such as session IDs, for session hijacking attacks\n(CVE-2007-3385).\nA directory traversal vulnerability existed in the Apache Tomcat webdav\nservlet. This allowed remote attackers to remote authenticated users to\nread accessible to the local user running the tomcat process (CVE-2007-5461).\nThe default security policy in the JULI logging component did not restrict\naccess permissions to files. This could be misused by untrusted web\napplications to access and write arbitrary files in the context of the\ntomcat process (CVE-2007-5342).\nUsers of Tomcat should update to these erratum packages, which contain\nbackported patches and are not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
