This could\nallow an attacker to perform a cross-site scripting attack if a victim was\ntricked into connecting to a site and sending a carefully crafted Expect\nheader.  (CVE-2006-3918)\nWhile a web browser cannot be forced to send an arbitrary Expect\nheader by a third-party attacker, it was recently discovered that\ncertain versions of the Flash plugin can manipulate request headers.\nIf users running such versions can be persuaded to load a web page\nwith a malicious Flash applet, a cross-site scripting attack against\nthe server may be possible.\nOn Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4 systems, due to an unrelated issue in\nthe handling of malformed Expect headers, the page produced by the\ncross-site scripting attack will only be returned after a timeout expires\n(2-5 minutes by default) if not first canceled by the user.\nUsers of httpd should update to these erratum packages, which contain a\nbackported patch to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
