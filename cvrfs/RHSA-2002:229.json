Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2002:229"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Moderate","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["The wget packages shipped with Red Hat Linux 6.2 through 8.0 contain a\nsecurity bug which, under certain circumstances, can cause local files to\nbe written outside the download directory.\n[Updated 10 July 2003]\nAdded packages for Red Hat Linux on IBM iSeries and pSeries systems","Versions of wget prior to 1.8.2-4 contain a bug that permits a malicious\nFTP server to create or overwrite files anywhere on the local file system.\nFTP clients must check to see if an FTP server's response to the NLST\ncommand includes any directory information along with the list of filenames\nrequired by the FTP protocol (RFC 959, section 4.1.3).\nIf the FTP client fails to do so, a malicious FTP server can send filenames\nbeginning with '/' or containing '/../' which can be used to direct a\nvulnerable FTP client to write files (such as .forward, .rhosts, .shost,\netc.) that can then be used for later attacks against the client machine.\nAll Red Hat Linux users using wget < 1.8.2-4  should upgrade\nto the errata packages which are not vulnerable to this issue.\nThanks to Steven M. Christey for his work in discovering this issue\nin current FTP clients and for providing a patched FTP server to verify\nthe new packages.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
