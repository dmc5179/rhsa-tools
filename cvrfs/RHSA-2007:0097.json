A\nmalicious web page could cause Firefox to crash or allow arbitrary code \nto be executed as the user running Firefox. (CVE-2007-0775, CVE-2007-0777)\nCross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in Firefox.  A malicious web\npage could display misleading information, allowing a user to unknowingly\ndivulge sensitive information, such as a password. (CVE-2006-6077, \nCVE-2007-0995, CVE-2007-0996)\nA flaw was found in the way Firefox processed JavaScript contained in\ncertain tags.  A malicious web page could cause Firefox to execute\nJavaScript code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.\n(CVE-2007-0994)\nA flaw was found in the way Firefox cached web pages on the local disk. A\nmalicious web page may have been able to inject arbitrary HTML into a\nbrowsing session if the user reloaded a targeted site. (CVE-2007-0778)\nCertain web content could overlay Firefox user interface elements such as\nthe hostname and security indicators.  A malicious web page could trick a\nuser into thinking they were visiting a different site. (CVE-2007-0779)\nTwo flaws were found in Firefox's displaying of blocked popup windows. If a\nuser could be convinced to open a blocked popup, it was possible to read\narbitrary local files, or conduct a cross-site scripting attack against the\nuser.\n(CVE-2007-0780, CVE-2007-0800)\nTwo buffer overflow flaws were found in the Network Security Services (NSS)\ncode for processing the SSLv2 protocol. Connecting to a malicious secure\nweb server could cause the execution of arbitrary code as the user running\nFirefox. (CVE-2007-0008, CVE-2007-0009)\nA flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the \"location.hostname\" value.\nA malicious web page could set domain cookies for an arbitrary site, or\npossibly perform a cross-site scripting attack. (CVE-2007-0981)\nUsers of Firefox are advised to upgrade to this erratum package, containing\nFirefox version 1.5.0.10 which is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
