A remote attacker could use this flaw to force\na proxy process to consume large amounts of CPU time. (CVE-2009-1890)\nA denial of service flaw was found in the Apache mod_deflate module. This\nmodule continued to compress large files until compression was complete,\neven if the network connection that requested the content was closed before\ncompression completed. This would cause mod_deflate to consume large\namounts of CPU if mod_deflate was enabled for a large file. (CVE-2009-1891)\nAll httpd users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.
