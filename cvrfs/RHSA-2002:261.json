Updated packages for Red Hat Linux\nAdvanced Server are available.\n[Updated 13 Jan 2003]\nAdded fixed packages for the Itanium (IA64) architecture.\n[Updated 06 Feb 2003]\nAdded fixed packages for Advanced Workstation 2.1","Canna is a kana-kanji conversion server which is necessary for Japanese\nlanguage character input. \nA buffer overflow bug in the Canna server up to and including version 3.5b2\nallows a local user to gain the privileges of the user 'bin' which can\nlead to further exploits. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-1158 to this issue.\nIn addition, it was discovered that request validation was lacking in Canna\nserver versions 3.6 and earlier. A malicious remote user could exploit this\nvulnerability to leak information or cause a denial of service attack. \n(CAN-2002-1159)\nRed Hat Linux Advanced Server ships with a Canna package vulnerable\nto these issues; however, the package is normally only installed when\nJapanese language support is selected during installation.\nAll users of Canna are advised to upgrade to these errata packages which\ncontain a backported security fix and are not vulnerable to this issue.\nRed Hat would like to thank hsj and AIDA Shinra for the responsible\ndisclosure of these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
