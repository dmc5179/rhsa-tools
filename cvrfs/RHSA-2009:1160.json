The httpd22 packages\nshipped with JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n4 contain an embedded copy of the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) utility\nlibrary, a free library of C data structures and routines, which includes\ninterfaces to support XML parsing, LDAP connections, database interfaces,\nURI parsing, and more.\nA denial of service flaw was found in the Apache mod_proxy module when it\nwas used as a reverse proxy. A remote attacker could use this flaw to force\na proxy process to consume large amounts of CPU time. (CVE-2009-1890)\nA denial of service flaw was found in the apr-util Extensible Markup\nLanguage (XML) parser. A remote attacker could create a specially-crafted\nXML document that would cause excessive memory consumption when processed\nby the XML decoding engine. (CVE-2009-1955)\nA heap-based underwrite flaw was found in the way apr-util created compiled\nforms of particular search patterns. An attacker could formulate a\nspecially-crafted search keyword, that would overwrite arbitrary heap\nmemory locations when processed by the pattern preparation engine.\n(CVE-2009-0023)\nA flaw was found in the handling of the \"Options\" and \"AllowOverride\"\ndirectives used by the Apache HTTP Server. In configurations using the\n\"AllowOverride\" directive with certain \"Options=\" arguments, local users\nwere not restricted from executing commands from a Server-Side-Include\nscript as intended. (CVE-2009-1195)\nA denial of service flaw was found in the Apache mod_deflate module. This\nmodule continued to compress large files until compression was complete,\neven if the network connection that requested the content was closed before\ncompression completed. This would cause mod_deflate to consume large\namounts of CPU if mod_deflate was enabled for a large file. (CVE-2009-1891)\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.0 should upgrade to these\nupdated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.\nAfter installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted\nfor the update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
