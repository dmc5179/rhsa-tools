By exploiting these issues it\nmay be possible to make Ethereal crash or run arbitrary code by injecting a\npurposefully malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to\nread a malformed packet trace file.\nMultiple off-by-one vulnerabilities exist in Ethereal 0.9.11 and earlier in\nthe AIM, GIOP Gryphon, OSPF, PPTP, Quake, Quake2, Quake3, Rsync, SMB, SMPP,\nand TSP dissectors. They do not properly use the tvb_get_nstringz and\ntvb_get_nstringz0 functions.   Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0356 to these issues.\nMultiple integer overflow vulnerabilities exist in Ethereal 0.9.11 and\nearlier in the Mount and PPP dissectors.  (CAN-2003-0357)\nA vulnerability in the DCERPC dissector exists in Ethereal 0.9.12 and\nearlier, allowing remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory\nconsumption) via a certain NDR string.  (CAN-2003-0428)\nThe OSI dissector in Ethereal 0.9.12 and earlier causes by invalid IPv4 or\nIPv6 prefix lengths, possibly triggering a buffer overflow. (CAN-2003-0429)\nThe SPNEGO dissector in Ethereal 0.9.12 and earlier allows remote attackers\nto cause a denial of service (crash) via an invalid ASN.1 value. \n(CAN-2003-0430)\nThe tvb_get_nstringz0 function in Ethereal 0.9.12 and earlier does not\nproperly handle a zero-length buffer size. (CAN-2003-0431)\nEthereal 0.9.12 and earlier does not handle certain strings properly in the\nBGP, WTP, DNS, 802.11, ISAKMP, WSP, CLNP, ISIS, and RMI dissectors.\n(CAN-2003-0432)\nUsers of Ethereal should update to the erratum packages containing Ethereal\nversion 0.9.13, which are not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
