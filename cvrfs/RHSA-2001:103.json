These packages close a remotely-exploitable vulnerability in\nfetchmail.","Fetchmail versions up to 5.8.9 are susceptible to remote attacks from\nmalicious servers.  When fetchmail attempts to create an index of messages\nin the remote mailbox being polled, it uses index numbers sent by the\nserver as an index into an internal array.  If a server sends fetchmail a\nnegative number, fetchmail will attempt to write data outside the bounds of\nthe array.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
