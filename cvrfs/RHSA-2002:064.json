Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2002:064"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["The Nautilus file manager in Red Hat Linux 7.2 has a symlink vulnerability.","The Nautilus file manager (used by default in the GNOME desktop\nenvironment) writes metadata files containing information about files and\ndirectories that have been visited in the file manager.\nThe metadata file code in Red Hat Linux 7.2 can be tricked into chasing\na symlink and overwriting the symlink target.\nThe errata packages repair this problem in two ways. First they create\nmetadata files using mkstemp() and then renaming the files, instead of\ncreating the files in-place with a fixed filename. This patch in the errata\npackages was backported from the latest upstream version of Nautilus on\ncvs.gnome.org.\nSecond, Nautilus used to have a preference to store metadata only in the \nuser's home directory, rather than in each directory being browsed. \nThis errata removes the preference and hardcodes its value to always \nuse the home directory. This disables the shared-metadata functionality,\nso if two users browse the same directory they may see different icons, \nemblems, and so forth.\nNautilus has only been shipped in Red Hat Linux 7.2; earlier\nversions do not contain Nautilus and thus are not vulnerable.\nThis problem should only be exploitable locally (filesystem access \nis needed to create a malicious symlink). If Nautilus is not run \nas root, the impact should be limited to overwriting files that\nunprivileged users have access to. If Nautilus is run as root, \na malicious symlink could overwrite system-critical files such \nas /etc/passwd with Nautilus metadata.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0157 to this issue. The BUGTRAQ ID for this \nissue is 4373.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
