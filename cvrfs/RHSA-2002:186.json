Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2002:186"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated scrollkeeper packages are now available for Red Hat Linux 7.3 which\nfix a tempfile vulnerability.","ScrollKeeper is a cataloging system for documentation. All versions of\nScrollKeeper between 0.3 and 0.3.11 have a tempfile vulnerability.\nThe scrollkeeper-get-cl command generates temporary files in the /tmp\ndirectory.  These files are named scrollkeeper-tempfile.[0-4], and while\ncreating these files scrollkeeper-get-cl follows symbolic links. These\nfiles are created when a user logs in to a GNOME session and are created as\nthe user who logged in. This means an attacker with local access can easily\ncreate and overwrite files as another user.\nThis errata updates ScrollKeeper packages for Red Hat Linux 7.3 with\npatches that prevent ScrollKeeper from following symlinks when creating\ntemporary files.  Previous releases of Red Hat Linux do not contain\nvulnerable versions of Scrollkeeper.\nThanks go to Spybreak for discovering and responsibly disclosing this\nvulnerability.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
