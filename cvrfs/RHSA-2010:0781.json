Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,\nwhich give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability\nfrom the CVE links in the References section.","SeaMonkey is an open source web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC\nchat client, and HTML editor.\nSeveral flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web\npage containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,\npotentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\nSeaMonkey. (CVE-2010-3176, CVE-2010-3180)\nA flaw was found in the way the Gopher parser in SeaMonkey converted text\ninto HTML. A malformed file name on a Gopher server could, when accessed by\na victim running SeaMonkey, allow arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in\nthe context of the Gopher domain. (CVE-2010-3177)\nA flaw was found in the script that launches SeaMonkey. The LD_LIBRARY_PATH\nvariable was appending a \".\" character, which could allow a local attacker\nto execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a different user running\nSeaMonkey, if that user ran SeaMonkey from within an attacker-controlled\ndirectory. (CVE-2010-3182)\nIt was found that the SSL DHE (Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral) mode\nimplementation for key exchanges in SeaMonkey accepted DHE keys that were\n256 bits in length. This update removes support for 256 bit DHE keys, as\nsuch keys are easily broken using modern hardware. (CVE-2010-3173)\nA flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey matched SSL certificates when the\ncertificates had a Common Name containing a wildcard and a partial IP\naddress. SeaMonkey incorrectly accepted connections to IP addresses that\nfell within the SSL certificate's wildcard range as valid SSL connections,\npossibly allowing an attacker to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack.\n(CVE-2010-3170)\nAll SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct\nthese issues. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for\nthe changes to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
