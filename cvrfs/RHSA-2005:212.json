DHCP is a protocol that allows\ndevices to get their own network configuration information from a server.\nA bug was found in the way dhcpd logs error messages.  A malicious DNS\nserver could send a carefully crafted DNS reply and cause dhcpd to crash or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0446 to this issue. \nAll users of dhcp should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a\nbackported patch and is not vulnerable to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
