Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.

The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0858 to\nthis issue. \nUsers of Quagga should upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain a\npatch that checks that netlink messages actually came from the kernel. \nThis erratum also includes quagga-devel and quagga-contrib packages which\nwere not originally shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
