A\nnumber of vulnerabilities were found in the Red Hat Linux Advanced Server\nkernel. These vulnerabilities could allow a local user to obtain elevated\n(root) privileges.\nThe vulnerabilities existed in a number of drivers, including\nstradis, rio500, se401, apm, usbserial, and usbvideo.\nAdditionally, a number of bugs have been fixed, and some small feature\nenhancements have been added.\n- Failed READA requests could be interpreted as I/O errors under high\nload on SMP; this has been fixed.\n- In rare cases, TLB entries could be corrupted on SMP Pentium IV\nsystems; this potential for corruption has been fixed. Third-party modules\nwill need to be recompiled to take advantage of these fixes.\n- The latest tg3 driver fixes have been included; the tg3 driver\nnow supports more hardware.\n- A mechanism is provided to specify the location of core files and to\nset the name pattern to include the UID, program, hostname, and PID of\nthe process that caused the core dump.\nA number of SCSI fixes have also been included:\n- Configure sparse LUNs in the qla2200 driver\n- Clean up erroneous accounting data as seen by /proc/partitions and iostat\n- Allow up to 128 scsi disks\n- Do not start logical units that require manual intervention, avoiding\nunnecessary startup delays\n- Improve SCSI layer throughput by properly clustering DMA requests\nAll users of Red Hat Linux Advanced Server are advised to upgrade to the\nerrata packages.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
