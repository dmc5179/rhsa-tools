Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,\nwhich give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability\nfrom the CVE links in the References section.","The Apache HTTP Server is a popular web server.\nIt was discovered that mod_proxy_ajp incorrectly returned an \"Internal\nServer Error\" response when processing certain malformed requests, which\ncaused the back-end server to be marked as failed in configurations where\nmod_proxy is used in load balancer mode. A remote attacker could cause\nmod_proxy to not send requests to back-end AJP (Apache JServ Protocol)\nservers for the retry timeout period (60 seconds by default) by sending\nspecially-crafted requests. (CVE-2010-0408)\nA use-after-free flaw was discovered in the way the Apache HTTP Server\nhandled request headers in subrequests. In configurations where subrequests\nare used, a multithreaded MPM (Multi-Processing Module) could possibly leak\ninformation from other requests in request replies. (CVE-2010-0434)\nThis update also adds the following enhancement:\n* with the updated openssl packages from RHSA-2010:0162 installed, mod_ssl\nwill refuse to renegotiate a TLS/SSL connection with an unpatched client\nthat does not support RFC 5746. This update adds the\n\"SSLInsecureRenegotiation\" configuration directive. If this directive is\nenabled, mod_ssl will renegotiate insecurely with unpatched clients.\n(BZ#567980)\nRefer to the following Red Hat Knowledgebase article for more details about\nthe changed mod_ssl behavior: http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-20491\nAll httpd users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues and add this enhancement. After\ninstalling the updated packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
