Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,\nwhich give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability\nfrom the CVE links in the References section.","The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n* On AMD64 systems, it was discovered that the kernel did not ensure the\nELF interpreter was available before making a call to the SET_PERSONALITY\nmacro. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service by\nrunning a 32-bit application that attempts to execute a 64-bit application.\n(CVE-2010-0307, Moderate)\n* Information leak flaws were found in the Linux kernel Traffic Control\nUnit implementation. A local attacker could use these flaws to cause the\nkernel to leak kernel memory to user-space, possibly leading to the\ndisclosure of sensitive information. (CVE-2010-2942, Moderate)\n* It was found that wireless drivers might not always clear allocated\nbuffers when handling a driver-specific IOCTL information request. A local\nuser could trigger this flaw to cause kernel memory to leak from the heap\nto user-space, leading to an information leak. (CVE-2010-2955, Moderate)\n* A flaw was found in the eql_g_master_cfg() function in the Linux kernel\nequalizer load-balancer for serial network interfaces implementation. A\ndata structure in eql_g_master_cfg() was not initialized properly before\nbeing copied to user-space. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw\nto cause an information leak. (CVE-2010-3297, Moderate)\nRed Hat would like to thank Mathias Krause for reporting CVE-2010-0307, and\nDan Rosenberg for reporting CVE-2010-3297.\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n* The mkinitrd utility reported the following warning message when creating\nan initial ramdisk:\nNo module dm-mem-cache found for kernel [version], aborting.\nThis was caused by an erroneous dependency on dmraid-related modules. This\nupdate removes these dependencies with the result that mkinitrd does not\nissue a spurious warning about the dm-mem-cache module not being found.\n(BZ#482753)\n* The ibm_rtl kernel module now performs more exhaustive checking to ensure\nit only loads on correct IBM hardware. (BZ#612275)\n* The realtime Linux kernel has been upgraded to upstream version\n2.6.33.7-rt29, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements for\nRed Hat Enterprise MRG 1.3. (BZ#638672)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which upgrade the kernel-rt\nkernel to version 2.6.33.7-rt29 to correct these issues. The system must be\nrebooted for this update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
