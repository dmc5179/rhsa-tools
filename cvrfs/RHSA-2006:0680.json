GnuTLS includes libtasn1, a library developed for\nASN.1 structures management that includes DER encoding and decoding.\nDaniel Bleichenbacher recently described an attack on PKCS #1 v1.5\nsignatures. Where an RSA key with exponent 3 is used it may be possible for\nan attacker to forge a PKCS #1 v1.5 signature that would be incorrectly\nverified by implementations that do not check for excess data in the RSA\nexponentiation result of the signature.\nThe core GnuTLS team discovered that GnuTLS is vulnerable to a variant of\nthe Bleichenbacker attack. This issue affects applications that use GnuTLS\nto verify X.509 certificates as well as other uses of PKCS #1 v1.5.\n(CVE-2006-4790)\nIn Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, the GnuTLS library is only used by the\nEvolution client when connecting to an Exchange server or when publishing\ncalendar information to a WebDAV server.\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a\nbackported patch from the GnuTLS maintainers to correct this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
