Such domain names are decoded in URLs and SSL certificates\nin a way that uses homograph characters from other character sets, which\nfacilitates phishing attacks. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0237 to this issue.\nSebastian Krahmer discovered a flaw in dcopserver, the KDE Desktop\nCommunication Protocol (DCOP) daemon.  A local user could use this flaw to\nstall the DCOP authentication process, affecting any local desktop users\nand causing a reduction in their desktop functionality.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2005-0396 to this issue.\nA flaw in the dcopidlng script was discovered. The dcopidlng script would\ncreate temporary files with predictable filenames which could allow local\nusers to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2005-0365 to this issue.\nUsers of KDE should upgrade to these erratum packages which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
