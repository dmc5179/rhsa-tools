Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.","OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)\nand Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a\nfull-strength, general purpose cryptography library.\nIt was discovered that OpenSSL did not always check the return value of the\nbn_wexpand() function. An attacker able to trigger a memory allocation\nfailure in that function could cause an application using the OpenSSL\nlibrary to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2009-3245)\nA flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure\nSockets Layer) protocols handled session renegotiation. A man-in-the-middle\nattacker could use this flaw to prefix arbitrary plain text to a client's\nsession (for example, an HTTPS connection to a website). This could force\nthe server to process an attacker's request as if authenticated using the\nvictim's credentials. This update addresses this flaw by implementing the\nTLS Renegotiation Indication Extension, as defined in RFC 5746.\n(CVE-2009-3555)\nRefer to the following Knowledgebase article for additional details about\nthe CVE-2009-3555 flaw: http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-20491\nA missing return value check flaw was discovered in OpenSSL, that could\npossibly cause OpenSSL to call a Kerberos library function with invalid\narguments, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference crash in the MIT\nKerberos library. In certain configurations, a remote attacker could use\nthis flaw to crash a TLS/SSL server using OpenSSL by requesting Kerberos\ncipher suites during the TLS handshake. (CVE-2010-0433)\nAll OpenSSL users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues. For the update to take effect,\nall services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system\nrebooted.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
