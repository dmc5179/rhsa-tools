The previous patch did not completely eliminate the\ninitial vulnerability and could lead to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks\nagainst a server.  It has not been verified if this issue could lead to\nfurther consequences, such as remote code execution.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
