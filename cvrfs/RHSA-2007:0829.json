An\nuntrusted application could elevate it's privileges, allowing it to read\nand write local files that are accessible to the user running the Java Web\nStart application. (CVE-2007-2435)\nA buffer overflow in the Java Runtime Environment image handling code was\nfound. An untrusted applet or application could use this flaw to elevate\nits privileges and potentially execute arbitrary code as the user running\nthe java virtual machine. (CVE-2007-2788, CVE-2007-2789, CVE-2007-3004)\nAn unspecified vulnerability was discovered in the Java Runtime\nEnvironment. An untrusted applet or application could cause the java\nvirtual machine to become unresponsive. (CVE-2007-3005)\nThe Javadoc tool was able to generate HTML documentation pages that\ncontained cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.  A remote attacker\ncould use this to inject arbitrary web script or HTML. (CVE-2007-3503)\nThe Java Web Start URL parsing component contains a buffer overflow\nvulnerability within the parsing code for JNLP files. A remote attacker\ncould create a malicious JNLP file that could trigger this flaw and execute\narbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2007-3655)\nA flaw was found in the applet class loader. An untrusted applet could use\nthis flaw to circumvent network access restrictions, possibly connecting\nto services hosted on the machine that executed the applet. (CVE-2007-3922)\nAll users of java-ibm-1.5.0 should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain IBM's 1.5.0 SR5a Java release that resolves these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
