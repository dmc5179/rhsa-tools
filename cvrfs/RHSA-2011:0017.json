Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.","The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the igb driver in the Linux\nkernel. If both the Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) feature and\npromiscuous mode were enabled on an interface using igb, it could result in\na denial of service when a tagged VLAN packet is received on that\ninterface. (CVE-2010-4263, Important)\n* A missing sanity check was found in vbd_create() in the Xen hypervisor\nimplementation. As CD-ROM drives are not supported by the blkback back-end\ndriver, attempting to use a virtual CD-ROM drive with blkback could trigger\na denial of service (crash) on the host system running the Xen hypervisor.\n(CVE-2010-4238, Moderate)\n* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel execve() system call implementation.\nA local, unprivileged user could cause large amounts of memory to be\nallocated but not visible to the OOM (Out of Memory) killer, triggering a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2010-4243, Moderate)\n* A flaw was found in fixup_page_fault() in the Xen hypervisor\nimplementation. If a 64-bit para-virtualized guest accessed a certain area\nof memory, it could cause a denial of service on the host system running\nthe Xen hypervisor. (CVE-2010-4255, Moderate)\n* A missing initialization flaw was found in the bfa driver used by Brocade\nFibre Channel Host Bus Adapters. A local, unprivileged user could use this\nflaw to cause a denial of service by reading a file in the\n\"/sys/class/fc_host/host#/statistics/\" directory. (CVE-2010-4343, Moderate)\n* Missing initialization flaws in the Linux kernel could lead to\ninformation leaks. (CVE-2010-3296, CVE-2010-3877, CVE-2010-4072,\nCVE-2010-4073, CVE-2010-4075, CVE-2010-4080, CVE-2010-4081, CVE-2010-4158,\nLow)\nRed Hat would like to thank Kosuke Tatsukawa for reporting CVE-2010-4263;\nVladymyr Denysov for reporting CVE-2010-4238; Brad Spengler for reporting\nCVE-2010-4243; Dan Rosenberg for reporting CVE-2010-3296, CVE-2010-4073,\nCVE-2010-4075, CVE-2010-4080, CVE-2010-4081, and CVE-2010-4158; Vasiliy\nKulikov for reporting CVE-2010-3877; and Kees Cook for reporting\nCVE-2010-4072.\nThese updated packages also include several hundred bug fixes for and\nenhancements to the Linux kernel.
