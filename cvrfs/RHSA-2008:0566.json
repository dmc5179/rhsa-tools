A user who has a revoked but otherwise valid\ncertificate could take advantage of this issue and bypass the revocation\nlist; however, in practice, they would have no way of influencing which\nrevoked certificate entries were missing or the time period.\n(CVE-2007-4994)\nAs well, these updated packages fix the following bugs:\n* due to a regression, signing a CRL with approximately 150,000 records may\nhave taken up to five minutes. In these updated packages, signing such CRLs\ntakes approximately twenty seconds.\n* a bug, which resulted in a 404 error, due to servers not handling Online\nCertificate Status Protocol (OCSP) requests in the GET method, has been\nresolved. This issue may have caused a system to use 100% CPU. As well,\nOCSP requests are now logged to the debug log file.\n* it was possible for a CRL update to run at the same time as a certificate\nstatus update. Now, CRL updating locks out the certificate status update\nthread.\n* inefficient LDAP search methods caused LDAP searches for a large number\nof revoked certificates to take up to twenty minutes or more for 100,000\ncertificates during CRL generation. The LDAP search method has been\nmodified to greatly improve LDAP search times.\n* the default OCSP verification path has changed since RHCS 7.1. These\nupdated packages add support for certificates that use the old\nAuthorityInfoAccess (AIA) URL.\n* an OCSP client submitting an OCSP request via the GET method may have\ncaused a \"NullPointerException\".\n* if an agent automatically approved a certificate signing request (CSR),\nusing AgentCertAuth, the resultant certificate contained blank Subject Alt\nName extension fields. A manual enrollment by the same agent produced a\ncertificate with the correct number of Subject Alt Names and no blank\nentries. With this update, automated enrollments via AgentCertAuth do not\nhave blank fields in issued certificates.\nUsers of Red Hat Certificate System should upgrade to these updated\npackages, which resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
