This\npackage includes the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and\nserver.\nOpenSSH stores hostnames, IP addresses, and keys in plaintext in the\nknown_hosts file.  A local attacker that has already compromised a user's\nSSH account could use this information to generate a list of additional\ntargets that are likely to have the same password or key.  (CVE-2005-2666)\nThe following bugs have also been fixed in this update:\n* The ssh client could abort the running connection when the server\napplication generated a large output at once.\n* When 'X11UseLocalhost' option was set to 'no' on systems with IPv6\nnetworking enabled, the X11 forwarding socket listened only for IPv6\nconnections.\n* When the privilege separation was enabled in /etc/ssh/sshd_config, some\nlog messages in the system log were duplicated and also had timestamps from\nan incorrect timezone.\nAll users of openssh should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
