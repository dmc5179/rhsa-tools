If mod_ssl was sent a client certificate\nwith a subject DN field longer than 6000 characters, a stack overflow\noccured if FakeBasicAuth had been enabled. In order to exploit this issue\nthe carefully crafted malicious certificate would have had to be signed by\na Certificate Authority which mod_ssl is configured to trust. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0488 to this issue.\nA remotely triggered memory leak in the Apache HTTP Server earlier than\nversion 2.0.50 was also discovered.  This allowed a remote attacker to\nperform a denial of service attack against the server by forcing it to\nconsume large amounts of memory.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0493 to this issue.\nUsers of the Apache HTTP server should upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain backported patches that address these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
