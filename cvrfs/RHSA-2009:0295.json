A remote attacker could use this flaw\nto bypass intended access restrictions. (CVE-2008-6123)\nThis issue only affected configurations where hosts.allow and hosts.deny\nwere used to limit access to the SNMP server. To obtain information from\nthe server, the attacker would have to successfully authenticate, usually\nby providing a correct community string.\nAll net-snmp users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\na backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the update, the\nsnmpd and snmptrapd daemons will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
