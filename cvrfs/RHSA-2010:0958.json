Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.","The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\nSecurity fixes:\n* Missing sanity checks in the Intel i915 driver in the Linux kernel could\nallow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their privileges.\n(CVE-2010-2962, Important)\n* A flaw in sctp_packet_config() in the Linux kernel's Stream Control\nTransmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation could allow a remote attacker\nto cause a denial of service. (CVE-2010-3432, Important)\n* A missing integer overflow check in snd_ctl_new() in the Linux kernel's\nsound subsystem could allow a local, unprivileged user on a 32-bit system\nto cause a denial of service or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2010-3442,\nImportant)\n* A flaw in sctp_auth_asoc_get_hmac() in the Linux kernel's SCTP\nimplementation. When iterating through the hmac_ids array, it did not reset\nthe last id element if it was out of range. This could allow a remote\nattacker to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2010-3705, Important)\n* Missing sanity checks in setup_arg_pages() in the Linux kernel. When\nmaking the size of the argument and environment area on the stack very\nlarge, it could trigger a BUG_ON(), resulting in a local denial of service.\n(CVE-2010-3858, Moderate)\n* A flaw in ethtool_get_rxnfc() in the Linux kernel's ethtool IOCTL\nhandler. When it is called with a large info.rule_cnt, it could allow a\nlocal user to cause an information leak. (CVE-2010-3861, Moderate)\n* A flaw in bcm_connect() in the Linux kernel's Controller Area Network\n(CAN) Broadcast Manager. On 64-bit systems, writing the socket address may\noverflow the procname character array. (CVE-2010-3874, Moderate)\n* A flaw in inet_csk_diag_dump() in the Linux kernel's module for\nmonitoring the sockets of INET transport protocols. By sending a netlink\nmessage with certain bytecode, a local, unprivileged user could cause a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2010-3880, Moderate)\n* Missing sanity checks in gdth_ioctl_alloc() in the gdth driver in the\nLinux kernel, could allow a local user with access to \"/dev/gdth\" on a\n64-bit system to cause a denial of service or escalate their privileges.\n(CVE-2010-4157, Moderate)\n* A use-after-free flaw in the mprotect() system call could allow a local,\nunprivileged user to cause a local denial of service. (CVE-2010-4169,\nModerate)\n* Missing initialization flaws in the Linux kernel could lead to\ninformation leaks.

It does not affect Red Hat\nEnterprise MRG, but as a preventive measure, this update removes the code.\nRed Hat would like to thank Kees Cook for reporting this vulnerability.\n(BZ#642469)\n* The kernel-rt spec file was missing the crypto, drm, generated, and trace\nheader directories when generating the kernel-rt-devel package, resulting\nin out-of-tree modules failing to build. (BZ#608784)\n* On computers without a supported Performance Monitoring Unit, a crash\nwould occur when running the \"perf top\" command, and occasionally other\nperf commands. perf software events are now marked as IRQ safe to avoid\nthis crash.
