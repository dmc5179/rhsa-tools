A number of security\nissues have been found in version 2.14.1:\nBugzilla allows remote attackers to display restricted products and\ncomponents via a direct HTTP request to queryhelp.cgi. (CAN-2002-0803)\nBugzilla, when configured to perform reverse DNS lookups, allows remote\nattackers to bypass IP restrictions by connecting from a system with a\nspoofed reverse DNS hostname. (CAN-2002-0804)\nBugzilla creates new directories with world-writable permissions and \ncreates the params file with world-writable permissions, which allows local\nusers to modify the files and execute code. (CAN-2002-0805)\nBugzilla allows authenticated users with editing privileges to delete other\nusers by directly calling the editusers.cgi script with the \"del\" option.\n(CAN-2002-0806)\nCross-site scripting vulnerabilities in Bugzilla could allow remote\nattackers to execute scripts as other Bugzilla users via the full name (real\nname) field, which is not properly quoted by editusers.cgi. (CAN-2002-0807)\nBugzilla, when performing a mass change, sets the groupset of all bugs to\nthe groupset of the first bug. This could inadvertently cause insecure\ngroupset permissions to be assigned to some bugs. (CAN-2002-0808)\nBugzilla does not properly handle URL-encoded field names that are\ngenerated by some browsers, which could cause certain fields to appear to\nbe unset. This has the effect of removing group permissions on bugs when\nbuglist.cgi is provided with the encoded field names. (CAN-2002-0809)\nBugzilla directs error messages from the syncshadowdb command to the HTML\noutput, which could leak sensitive information, including plaintext\npasswords, if syncshadowdb fails. (CAN-2002-0810)\nBugzilla may allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or execute\ncertain queries via a SQL injection attack on the sort order parameter to\nbuglist.cgi. (CAN-2002-0811)\nAll users of Bugzilla are advised to upgrade to these errata packages\ncontaining Bugzilla version 2.14.3 which is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
