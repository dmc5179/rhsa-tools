When mounting a\nCIFS share, a malicious server could send an overly-long string to the\nclient, possibly leading to a denial of service or privilege escalation on\nthe client mounting the CIFS share. (CVE-2009-1439, Important)\n* the Linux kernel Network File System daemon (nfsd) implementation did not\ndrop the CAP_MKNOD capability when handling requests from local,\nunprivileged users. This flaw could possibly lead to an information leak or\nprivilege escalation. (CVE-2009-1072, Moderate)\n* a deficiency was found in the Linux kernel signals implementation. The\nkill_something_info() function did not check if a process was outside the\ncaller's namespace before sending the kill signal, making it possible to\nkill processes in all process ID (PID) namespaces, breaking PID namespace\nisolation. (CVE-2009-1338, Moderate)\n* a flaw was found in the AGPGART driver. The agp_generic_alloc_page() and\nagp_generic_alloc_pages() functions did not zero out the memory pages they\nallocate, which may later be available to user-space processes. This flaw\ncould possibly lead to an information leak. (CVE-2009-1192, Low)\nThese updated packages also fix the following bugs:\n* the \"-fwrapv\" flag was added to the gcc build options to prevent gcc from\noptimizing away wrapping arithmetic, as optimizing away wrapping may lead\nto unexpected results. (BZ#491264)\n* the bnx2x driver may have failed when highly-stressed by network\nstress-tests, resulting in network access being unavailable. This driver\nhas been updated to resolve this issue. (BZ#495472)\n* the file system mask, which lists capabilities for users with a file\nsystem user ID (fsuid) of 0, was missing the CAP_MKNOD and\nCAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capabilities. This could, potentially, allow users with\nan fsuid other than 0 to perform actions on some file system types that\nwould otherwise be prevented. This update adds these capabilities.\n(BZ#497047)\n* \"/proc/[pid]/maps\" and \"/proc/[pid]/smaps\" can only be read by processes\nable to use the ptrace() call on a given process; however, certain\ninformation from \"/proc/[pid]/stat\" and \"/proc/[pid]/wchan\" could be used\nto reconstruct memory maps, making it possible to bypass the Address Space\nLayout Randomization (ASLR) security feature. This update addresses this\nissue. (BZ#499550)\n* the get_random_int() function returned the same number until the jiffies\ncounter (which ticks at a clock interrupt frequency) or process ID (PID)\nchanged, making it possible to predict the random numbers. This may have\nhelped to bypass the ASLR security feature. With this update,\nget_random_int() is more random and no longer uses a common seed value.\nThis reduces the possibility of predicting the values get_random_int()\nreturns. (BZ#499787)\nAll Red Hat Enterprise MRG users should upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain backported patches to resolve these issues. Note: The system\nmust be rebooted for this update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
