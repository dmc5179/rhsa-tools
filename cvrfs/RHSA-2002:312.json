LDAP is a set of protocols for\naccessing directory services. In an audit of OpenLDAP by SuSE, a number of\npotential security issues were found.\nThe following is a list of these issues:\nWhen reading configuration files, libldap reads the current user's .ldaprc\nfile even in applications being run with elevated privileges.\nSlurpd would overflow an internal buffer if the command-line argument used\nwith the -t or -r flags is too long, or if the name of a file for which it\nattempted to create an advisory lock is too long.\nWhen parsing filters, the getfilter family of functions from libldap can\noverflow an internal buffer by supplying a carefully crafted\nldapfilter.conf file.\nWhen processing LDAP entry display templates, libldap can overflow an\ninternal buffer by supplying a carefully crafted ldaptemplates.conf file.\nWhen parsing an access control list, slapd can overflow an internal buffer.\nWhen constructing the name of the file used for logging rejected\nreplication requests, slapd overflows an internal buffer if the size\nof the generated name is too large. It can also destroy the contents of any\nfile owned by the user 'ldap' due to a race condition in the subsequent\ncreation of the log file.\nAll of these potential security issues are corrected by the packages\ncontained within this erratum.\nRed Hat Linux Advanced Server users who use LDAP are advised to\ninstall the updated OpenLDAP packages contained within this erratum.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
