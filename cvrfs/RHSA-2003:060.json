Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003:060"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Important","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated NetPBM packages are available that fix a number of vulnerabilities\nin the netpbm libraries.","The netpbm package contains a library of functions that support\nprograms for handling various graphics file formats, including .pbm\n(portable bitmaps), .pgm (portable graymaps), .pnm (portable anymaps),\n.ppm (portable pixmaps), and others.\nDuring an audit of the NetPBM library, Al Viro, Alan Cox, and Sebastian\nKrahmer found a number of bugs that are potentially exploitable.  These\nbugs could be exploited by creating a carefully crafted image in such a way\nthat it executes arbitrary code when it is processed by either an\napplication from the netpbm-progs package or an application that uses the\nvulnerable netpbm library.\nOne way that an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities would be to \nsubmit a carefully crafted image to be printed, as the LPRng print spooler\nused by default in Red Hat Linux releases uses netpbm utilities to parse\nvarious types of image files.\nUsers are advised to upgrade to the erratum packages, which contain patches\nthat correct these vulnerabilities.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
