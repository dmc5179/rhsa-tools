Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003:224"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Low","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated OpenSSH packages are now available.  These updates close an\ninformation leak caused by sshd's interaction with the PAM system.","OpenSSH is a suite of network connectivity tools that can be used to\nestablish encrypted connections between systems on a network and can\nprovide interactive login sessions and port forwarding, among other functions.\nWhen configured to allow password-based or challenge-response\nauthentication, sshd (the OpenSSH server) uses PAM (Pluggable\nAuthentication Modules) to verify the user's password.  Under certain\nconditions, OpenSSH versions prior to 3.6.1p1 reject an invalid\nauthentication attempt without first attempting authentication using PAM.\nIf PAM is configured with its default failure delay, the amount of time\nsshd takes to reject an invalid authentication request varies widely enough\nthat the timing variations could be used to deduce whether or not an\naccount with a specified name existed on the server.  This information\ncould then be used to narrow the focus of an attack against some other\nsystem component.\nThese updates contain backported fixes that cause sshd to always attempt\nPAM authentication when performing password and challenge-response\nauthentication for clients.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
