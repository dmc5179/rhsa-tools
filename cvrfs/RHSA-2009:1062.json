It also loads, hints, and renders individual glyphs\nefficiently. These packages provide both the FreeType 1 and FreeType 2\nfont engines.\nTavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team discovered several integer\noverflow flaws in the FreeType 2 font engine. If a user loaded a\ncarefully-crafted font file with an application linked against FreeType 2,\nit could cause the application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the user running the application.\n(CVE-2009-0946)\nChris Evans discovered multiple integer overflow flaws in the FreeType font\nengine. If a user loaded a carefully-crafted font file with an application\nlinked against FreeType, it could cause the application to crash or,\npossibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\nthe application. (CVE-2006-1861)\nAn integer overflow flaw was found in the way the FreeType font engine\nprocessed TrueType® Font (TTF) files. If a user loaded a carefully-crafted\nfont file with an application linked against FreeType, it could cause the\napplication to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2007-2754)\nNote: For the FreeType 2 font engine, the CVE-2006-1861 and CVE-2007-2754\nflaws were addressed via RHSA-2006:0500 and RHSA-2007:0403 respectively.\nThis update provides corresponding updates for the FreeType 1 font engine,\nincluded in the freetype packages distributed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n2.1.\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues. The X server must be restarted\n(log out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
