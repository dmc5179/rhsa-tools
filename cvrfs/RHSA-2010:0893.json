A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\nbase score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the\nCVE link in the References section.","The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\nThis update fixes the following security issue:\n* Buffer overflow flaws were found in the Linux kernel's implementation of\nthe server-side External Data Representation (XDR) for the Network File\nSystem (NFS) version 4. An attacker on the local network could send a\nspecially-crafted large compound request to the NFSv4 server, which could\npossibly result in a kernel panic (denial of service) or, potentially, code\nexecution. (CVE-2010-2521, Important)\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n* A race condition existed when generating new process IDs with the result\nthat the wrong process could have been signaled or killed accidentally,\nleading to various application faults. This update detects and disallows\nthe reuse of PID numbers. (BZ#638864)\n* When multiple JBD-based (Journaling Block Device) file systems were\nmounted concurrently, and no other JBD-based file systems were already\nmounted, a race could occur between JBD slab cache creation and deletion.\n(BZ#645653)\n* A missing memory barrier caused a race condition in the AIO subsystem\nbetween the read_events() and aio_complete() functions. This may have\ncaused a thread in read_events() to sleep indefinitely, possibly causing an\napplication hang. (BZ#638868)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
