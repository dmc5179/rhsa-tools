PNG\nis a bit-mapped graphics format similar to the GIF format. \nUnpatched versions of libpng 1.2.1 and earlier do not correctly calculate\noffsets, which leads to a buffer overflow and the possibility of arbitrary\ncode execution.  This could be exploited by an attacker creating a\ncarefully crafted PNG file which could execute arbitrary code when the\nvictim views it.\nPackages within Red Hat Linux Advanced Server, such as Mozilla, make use of\nthe shared libpng library.  All users are advised to upgrade to the errata\npackages, which contain libpng 1.0.14 with a backported patch that corrects\nthis issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
