On a system\nwhere Ethereal is running, a remote attacker could send malicious packets\nto trigger these flaws.\nA flaw in the DICOM dissector could cause a crash.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-1139 to this issue.\nA invalid RTP timestamp could hang Ethereal and create a large temporary\nfile, possibly filling available disk space. (CAN-2004-1140)\nThe HTTP dissector could access previously-freed memory, causing a crash.\n(CAN-2004-1141)\nAn improperly formatted SMB packet could make Ethereal hang, maximizing CPU\nutilization.  (CAN-2004-1142)\nThe COPS dissector could go into an infinite loop. (CAN-2005-0006)\nThe DLSw dissector could cause an assertion, making Ethereal exit\nprematurely. (CAN-2005-0007)\nThe DNP dissector could cause memory corruption. (CAN-2005-0008)\nThe Gnutella dissector could cause an assertion, making Ethereal exit\nprematurely. (CAN-2005-0009)\nThe MMSE dissector could free static memory, causing a crash. (CAN-2005-0010)\nThe X11 protocol dissector is vulnerable to a string buffer overflow.\n(CAN-2005-0084) \nUsers of Ethereal should upgrade to these updated packages which contain\nversion 0.10.9 that is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
