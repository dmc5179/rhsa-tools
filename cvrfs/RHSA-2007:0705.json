To access the DRM functionality\na user must have access to the X server which is granted through the\ngraphical login. This also only affected systems with an Intel 965 or later\ngraphic chipset. (CVE-2007-3851, Important)\n* a flaw in the VFAT compat ioctl handling on 64-bit systems that allowed a\nlocal user to corrupt a kernel_dirent struct and cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2007-2878, Important)\n* a flaw in the connection tracking support for SCTP that allowed a remote\nuser to cause a denial of service by dereferencing a NULL pointer.\n(CVE-2007-2876, Important)\n* flaw in the CIFS filesystem which could cause the umask values of a\nprocess to not be honored. This affected CIFS filesystems where the Unix\nextensions are supported. (CVE-2007-3740, Important)\n* a flaw in the stack expansion when using the hugetlb kernel on PowerPC\nsystems that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2007-3739, Moderate)\n* a flaw in the ISDN CAPI subsystem that allowed a remote user to cause a\ndenial of service or potential remote access. Exploitation would require\nthe attacker to be able to send arbitrary frames over the ISDN network to\nthe victim's machine. (CVE-2007-1217, Moderate)\n* a flaw in the cpuset support that allowed a local user to obtain\nsensitive information from kernel memory. To exploit this the cpuset\nfilesystem would have to already be mounted. (CVE-2007-2875, Moderate)\n* a flaw in the CIFS handling of the mount option \"sec=\" that didn't enable\nintegrity checking and didn't produce any error message. (CVE-2007-3843,\nLow)\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5 users are advised to upgrade to these packages,\nwhich contain backported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
