A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,\nwhich gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in\nthe References section.","The sudo (superuser do) utility allows system administrators to give\ncertain users the ability to run commands as root.\nA flaw was found in the way sudo handled the presence of duplicated\nenvironment variables. A local user authorized to run commands using sudo\ncould use this flaw to set additional values for the environment variables\nset by sudo, which could result in those values being used by the executed\ncommand instead of the values set by sudo. This could possibly lead to\ncertain intended restrictions being bypassed, such as the secure_path\nsetting. (CVE-2010-1646)\nRed Hat would like to thank Anders Kaseorg and Evan Broder of Ksplice, Inc.\nfor responsibly reporting this issue.\nUsers of sudo should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a\nbackported patch to correct this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
