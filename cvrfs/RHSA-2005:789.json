If a user\nviews a specially crafted XBM file, it becomes possible to execute\narbitrary code as the user running Mozilla. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-2701 to\nthis issue.\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla processes certain Unicode\nsequences. It may be possible to execute arbitrary code as the user running\nMozilla, if the user views a specially crafted Unicode sequence.\n(CAN-2005-2702)\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla makes XMLHttp requests. It is possible\nthat a malicious web page could leverage this flaw to exploit other proxy\nor server flaws from the victim's machine. It is also possible that this\nflaw could be leveraged to send XMLHttp requests to hosts other than the\noriginator; the default behavior of the browser is to disallow this.\n(CAN-2005-2703)\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla implemented its XBL interface. It may be\npossible for a malicious web page to create an XBL binding in a way\nthat would allow arbitrary JavaScript execution with chrome permissions.\nPlease note that in Mozilla 1.7.10 this issue is not directly exploitable\nand would need to leverage other unknown exploits. (CAN-2005-2704)\nAn integer overflow bug was found in Mozilla's JavaScript engine. Under\nfavorable conditions, it may be possible for a malicious web page to\nexecute arbitrary code as the user running Mozilla. (CAN-2005-2705)\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla displays about: pages. It is possible\nfor a malicious web page to open an about: page, such as about:mozilla, in\nsuch a way that it becomes possible to execute JavaScript with chrome\nprivileges. (CAN-2005-2706)\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla opens new windows. It is possible for a\nmalicious web site to construct a new window without any user interface\ncomponents, such as the address bar and the status bar. This window could\nthen be used to mislead the user for malicious purposes. (CAN-2005-2707)\nUsers of Mozilla are advised to upgrade to this updated package that\ncontains Mozilla version 1.7.12 and is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
