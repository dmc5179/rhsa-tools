Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,\nwhich give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability\nfrom the CVE links in the References section.","Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) provide a system whereby\nadministrators can set up authentication policies without having to\nrecompile programs that handle authentication.\nIt was discovered that the pam_namespace module executed the external\nscript namespace.init with an unchanged environment inherited from an\napplication calling PAM. In cases where such an environment was untrusted\n(for example, when pam_namespace was configured for setuid applications\nsuch as su or sudo), a local, unprivileged user could possibly use this\nflaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2010-3853)\nIt was discovered that the pam_env and pam_mail modules used root\nprivileges while accessing user's files. A local, unprivileged user could\nuse this flaw to obtain information, from the lines that have the KEY=VALUE\nformat expected by pam_env, from an arbitrary file. Also, in certain\nconfigurations, a local, unprivileged user using a service for which the\npam_mail module was configured for, could use this flaw to obtain limited\ninformation about files or directories that they do not have access to.\n(CVE-2010-3435)\nNote: As part of the fix for CVE-2010-3435, this update changes the default\nvalue of pam_env's configuration option user_readenv to 0, causing the\nmodule to not read user's ~/.pam_environment configuration file by default,\nas reading it may introduce unexpected changes to the environment of the\nservice using PAM, or PAM modules consulted after pam_env.\nIt was discovered that the pam_xauth module did not verify the return\nvalues of the setuid() and setgid() system calls. A local, unprivileged\nuser could use this flaw to execute the xauth command with root privileges\nand make it read an arbitrary input file. (CVE-2010-3316)\nRed Hat would like to thank Sebastian Krahmer of the SuSE Security Team for\nreporting the CVE-2010-3435 issue.\nAll pam users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
