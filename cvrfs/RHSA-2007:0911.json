On sites where\na reverse proxy is configured, a remote attacker could send a carefully\ncrafted request that would cause the Apache child process handling that\nrequest to crash. On sites where a forward proxy is configured, an attacker\ncould cause a similar crash if a user could be persuaded to visit a\nmalicious site using the proxy. This could lead to a denial of service if\nusing a threaded Multi-Processing Module. (CVE-2007-3847)\nA flaw was found in the mod_autoindex module.  On sites where directory\nlistings are used, and the AddDefaultCharset directive has been removed\nfrom the configuration, a cross-site-scripting attack may be possible\nagainst browsers which do not correctly derive the response character set\nfollowing the rules in RFC 2616. (CVE-2007-4465)\nUsers of httpd should upgrade to these updated packages which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
