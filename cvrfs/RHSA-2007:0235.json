Certain processes which conduct their own\nauthentication could allow a remote user to bypass intended access policies\nwhich would normally be enforced by the login process. (CVE-2006-7108)\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n* The partx, addpart and delpart commands were not documented.\n* The \"umount -l\" command did not work on hung NFS mounts with cached data.\n* The mount command did not mount NFS V3 share where sec=none was specified.\n* The mount command did not read filesystem LABEL from unpartitioned disks.\n* The mount command did not recognize labels on VFAT filesystems.\n* The fdisk command did not support 4096 sector size for the \"-b\" option.\n* The mount man page did not list option \"mand\" or information about\n/etc/mtab limitations.\nAll users of util-linux should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
