This could allow an attacker to bypass quoting restrictions imposed\nby escapeshellcmd() and execute arbitrary commands if the PHP script was\nusing certain locales. Scripts using the default UTF-8 locale are not\naffected by this issue. (CVE-2008-2051)\nPHP functions htmlentities() and htmlspecialchars() did not properly\nrecognize partial multi-byte sequences. Certain sequences of bytes could be\npassed through these functions without being correctly HTML-escaped.\nDepending on the browser being used, an attacker could use this flaw to\nconduct cross-site scripting attacks. (CVE-2007-5898)\nA PHP script which used the transparent session ID configuration option, or\nwhich used the output_add_rewrite_var() function, could leak session\nidentifiers to external web sites. If a page included an HTML form with an\nACTION attribute referencing a non-local URL, the user's session ID would\nbe included in the form data passed to that URL. (CVE-2007-5899)\nIt was discovered that PHP fnmatch() function did not restrict the length\nof the string argument. An attacker could use this flaw to crash the PHP\ninterpreter where a script used fnmatch() on untrusted input data.\n(CVE-2007-4782)\nIt was discovered that PHP did not properly seed its pseudo-random number\ngenerator used by functions such as rand() and mt_rand(), possibly allowing\nan attacker to easily predict the generated pseudo-random values.\n(CVE-2008-2107, CVE-2008-2108)\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
