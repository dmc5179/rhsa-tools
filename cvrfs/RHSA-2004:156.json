Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of\nup2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be\ndownloaded directly from the RHN website:\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2004:156"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Important","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["An updated mailman package that closes a DoS vulnerability in mailman\nintroduced by RHSA-2004:019 is now available.","Mailman is a mailing list manager.\nOn February 19 2004, Red Hat issued security erratum RHSA-2004:019 to\ncorrect a DoS (Denial of Service) vulnerability where an attacker could\nsend a carefully-crafted message and cause mailman to crash. \nMatthew Saltzman discovered a flaw in our original patch intended to\ncorrect this vulnerability.  This flaw can cause mailman to crash if it\nreceives an email destined for a list with an empty subject field.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2004-0182 to this issue.\nUsers of Mailman are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ninclude an updated patch and are not vulnerable to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
