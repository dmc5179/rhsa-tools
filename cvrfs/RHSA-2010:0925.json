Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.","Kerberos is a network authentication system which allows clients and\nservers to authenticate to each other using symmetric encryption and a\ntrusted third party, the Key Distribution Center (KDC).\nMultiple checksum validation flaws were discovered in the MIT Kerberos\nimplementation. A remote attacker could use these flaws to tamper with\ncertain Kerberos protocol packets and, possibly, bypass authentication or\nauthorization mechanisms and escalate their privileges. (CVE-2010-1323,\nCVE-2010-1324, CVE-2010-4020)\nRed Hat would like to thank the MIT Kerberos Team for reporting these\nissues.\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n* When attempting to perform PKINIT pre-authentication, if the client had\nmore than one possible candidate certificate the client could fail to\nselect the certificate and key to use. This usually occurred if certificate\nselection was configured to use the value of the keyUsage extension, or if\nany of the candidate certificates did not contain a subjectAltName\nextension. Consequently, the client attempted to perform pre-authentication\nusing a different (usually password-based) mechanism. (BZ#644825)\nAll krb5 users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues. After installing the updated\npackages, the krb5kdc daemon will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
