A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,\nwhich gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in\nthe References section.","The gfs-kmod packages contain modules that provide the ability to mount and\nuse GFS file systems.\nA flaw was found in the gfs_lock() implementation. The GFS locking code\ncould skip the lock operation for files that have the S_ISGID bit\n(set-group-ID on execution) in their mode set. A local, unprivileged user\non a system that has a GFS file system mounted could use this flaw to cause\na kernel panic. (CVE-2010-0727)\nThese updated gfs-kmod packages are in sync with the latest kernel\n(2.6.18-164.19.1.el5). The modules in earlier gfs-kmod packages failed to\nload because they did not match the running kernel. It was possible to\nforce-load the modules. With this update, however, users no longer need to.\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these latest gfs-kmod packages, updated for\nuse with the 2.6.18-164.19.1.el5 kernel, which contain a backported patch\nto correct this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
