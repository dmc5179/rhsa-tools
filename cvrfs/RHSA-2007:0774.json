Exploitation would require\nthe attacker to be able to send arbitrary frames over the ISDN network to\nthe victim's machine. (CVE-2007-1217, Moderate) \n* a flaw in the perfmon subsystem on ia64 platforms that allowed a local\nuser to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2006-0558, Moderate)\nIn addition, the following bugs were addressed:\n* a panic after reloading of the LSI Fusion driver.\n* a vm performance problem was corrected by balancing inactive page lists.\n* added a nodirplus option to address NFSv3 performance issues with large\ndirectories.\n* changed the personality handling to disallow personality changes of\nsetuid and setgid binaries. This ensures they keep any randomization and\nExec-shield protection.\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users are advised to upgrade their kernels\nto the packages associated with their machine architectures and\nconfigurations as listed in this erratum.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
