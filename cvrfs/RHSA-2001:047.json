drivers have been updated, and NFS version 3 has been\nintegrated.","All Linux kernels prior to version 2.2.19 include possibilities for local\ndenial of service or root exploits by exercising race conditions between\nthe ptrace, exec, and/or suid system calls.  Additionally, the sysctl\nsystem call included programming errors allowing a user to write to kernel\nmemory.  The 2.2.19 kernel fixes these problems.\nMinor potential problems in the virtual memory and signal delivery\nsubsystems are also corrected.\nMany drivers have been updated since the release of 2.2.17, our last\nofficial kernel release, including but not limited to: 3c59x, AGP, CS46xx,\nDAC960, EMU10K, Maestro 3, NE2000/PCI, Tulip, and various USB devices.  \nThe\nmissing Intel E100 driver is now included.  A hang while booting on some\ncomputers due inadvertent inclusion of a toshiba driver has been fixed.\nFinally, support for NFS version 3 has been included, which has much\nimproved performance characteristics compared to earlier versions.  In\norder to support this, new versions of nfs-utils and mount are required.\n2001-04-17: missing rpc.rquotad added to nfs-utils. This is only \nnecessary for those using disk quotas withi NFS.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
