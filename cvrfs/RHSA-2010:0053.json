The skb->dst data structure was not\nproperly validated in the ipv6_hop_jumbo() function. This could possibly\nlead to a remote denial of service. (CVE-2007-4567, Important)\n* a flaw was found in each of the following Intel PRO/1000 Linux\ndrivers in the Linux kernel: e1000 and e1000e. A remote attacker using\npackets larger than the MTU could bypass the existing fragment check,\nresulting in partial, invalid frames being passed to the network stack.\nThese flaws could also possibly be used to trigger a remote denial of\nservice. (CVE-2009-4536, CVE-2009-4538, Important)\n* a flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux\nkernel. Receiving overly-long frames with a certain revision of the network\ncards supported by this driver could possibly result in a remote denial of\nservice. (CVE-2009-4537, Important)\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n* on certain hardware, the igb driver was unable to detect link statuses\ncorrectly for Serializer-Deserializer (SERDES) interface Ethernet ports.\nThis may have caused problems for network interface bonding, such as\nfailover not occurring. (BZ#548023)\n* in certain situations, kdump occasionally dumped a vmcore file with no\nregisters on Intel Itanium systems that were under high disk I/O load. In\nthese cases, this prevented the kernel stack backtrace in the vmcore from\nbeing viewed with the crash utility. (BZ#542581)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
