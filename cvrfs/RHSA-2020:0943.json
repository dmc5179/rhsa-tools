A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.","Samba is an open-source implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol and the related Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol, which allows PC-compatible machines to share files, printers, and various information.\nThe Samba packages have been upgraded to upstream version 4.10.4, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version. (BZ#1776952)\nSecurity Fix(es):\n* samba: smb client vulnerable to filenames containing path separators (CVE-2019-10218)\n* samba: Crash after failed character conversion at log level 3 or above (CVE-2019-14907)\nBug Fix(es):\n* Earlier, the directory entries did not initialize completely and hence Samba did not check correctly for DFS redirects. The Windows Explorer did not display the DFS redirects properly and instead of showing the redirects as directories, Samba displayed the redirects as files. With this fix, the Samba's vfs_glusterfs module has been fixed so that DFS redirects now work as expected. (BZ#1784827)\nUsers of Samba with Red Hat Gluster Storage are advised to upgrade to these updated packages","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
