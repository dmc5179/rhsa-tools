Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,\nwhich give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability\nfrom the CVE links in the References section.","PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache\nHTTP Server.\nA flaw was found in the way PHP converted certain floating point values\nfrom string representation to a number. If a PHP script evaluated an\nattacker's input in a numeric context, the PHP interpreter could cause high\nCPU usage until the script execution time limit is reached. This issue only\naffected i386 systems. (CVE-2010-4645)\nA numeric truncation error and an input validation flaw were found in the\nway the PHP utf8_decode() function decoded partial multi-byte sequences\nfor some multi-byte encodings, sending them to output without them being\nescaped. An attacker could use these flaws to perform a cross-site\nscripting attack. (CVE-2009-5016, CVE-2010-3870)\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the PHP\nZipArchive::getArchiveComment function. If a script used this function to\ninspect a specially-crafted ZIP archive file, it could cause the PHP\ninterpreter to crash. (CVE-2010-3709)\nAll php users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the updated\npackages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
