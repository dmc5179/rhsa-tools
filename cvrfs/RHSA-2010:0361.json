A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,\nwhich gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in\nthe References section.","The sudo (superuser do) utility allows system administrators to give\ncertain users the ability to run commands as root.\nThe RHBA-2010:0212 sudo update released as part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n5.5 added the ability to change the value of the ignore_dot option in the\n\"/etc/sudoers\" configuration file. This ability introduced a regression in\nthe upstream fix for CVE-2010-0426. In configurations where the ignore_dot\noption was set to off (the default is on for the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5\nsudo package), a local user authorized to use the sudoedit pseudo-command\ncould possibly run arbitrary commands with the privileges of the users\nsudoedit was authorized to run as. (CVE-2010-1163)\nRed Hat would like to thank Todd C. Miller, the upstream sudo maintainer,\nfor responsibly reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Valerio\nCostamagna as the original reporter.\nUsers of sudo should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a\nbackported patch to correct this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
