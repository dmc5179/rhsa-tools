Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.

These updates resolve a vulnerability which would allow users to\nremove non-mandatory attributes from any object in a directory.","Versions of OpenLDAP from 2.0.0 through 2.0.19 do not check permissions\nusing access control lists when a user attempts to remove an attribute from\nan object in the directory by replacing its values with an empty list. \nBecause schema checking is still enforced, a user can only remove\nattributes which the schema does not require the object to possess.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0045 to this issue.\nThese packages update OpenLDAP to version 2.0.21 which is not vulnerable to\nthis problem.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
