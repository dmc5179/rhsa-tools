This is the\nfifth regular update.","The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.\nThis is the fifth regular kernel update to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.\nNew features introduced by this update include:\n- support for 2-TB partitions on block devices\n- support for new disk, network, and USB devices\n- support for clustered APIC mode on AMD64 NUMA systems\n- netdump support on AMD64, Intel EM64T, Itanium, and ppc64 systems\n- diskdump support on sym53c8xx and SATA piix/promise adapters\n- NMI switch support on AMD64 and Intel EM64T systems\nThere were many bug fixes in various parts of the kernel.  The ongoing\neffort to resolve these problems has resulted in a marked improvement\nin the reliability and scalability of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.\nSome key areas affected by these fixes include the kernel's networking,\nSATA, TTY, and USB subsystems, as well as the architecture-dependent\nhandling under the ia64, ppc64, and x86_64 directories.  Scalability\nimprovements were made primarily in the memory management and file\nsystem areas.\nA flaw in offset handling in the xattr file system code backported to\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 3 was fixed.  On 64-bit systems, a user who\ncan access an ext3 extended-attribute-enabled file system could cause\na denial of service (system crash).  This issue is rated as having a\nmoderate security impact (CAN-2005-0757).\nThe following device drivers have been upgraded to new versions:\n3c59x ------ LK1.1.18\n3w-9xxx ---- 2.24.00.011fw (new in Update 5)\n3w-xxxx ---- 1.02.00.037\n8139too ---- (upstream 2.4.29)\nb44 -------- 0.95\ncciss ------ v2.4.54.RH1\ne100 ------- 3.3.6-k2\ne1000 ------ 5.6.10.1-k2\nlpfcdfc ---- 1.0.13 (new in Update 5)\ntg3 -------- 3.22RH\nNote: The kernel-unsupported package contains various drivers and modules\nthat are unsupported and therefore might contain security problems that\nhave not been addressed.\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 users are advised to upgrade their\nkernels to the packages associated with their machine architectures\nand configurations as listed in this erratum.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
