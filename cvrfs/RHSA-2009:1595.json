A remote attacker could, in a\nspecially-crafted way, query for the list of current print jobs for a\nspecific printer, leading to a denial of service (cupsd crash).\n(CVE-2009-3553)\nSeveral cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the way the CUPS web\nserver interface processed HTML form content. If a remote attacker could\ntrick a local user who is logged into the CUPS web interface into visiting\na specially-crafted HTML page, the attacker could retrieve and potentially\nmodify confidential CUPS administration data. (CVE-2009-2820)\nRed Hat would like to thank Aaron Sigel of Apple Product Security for\nresponsibly reporting the CVE-2009-2820 issue.\nUsers of cups are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the\nupdate, the cupsd daemon will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
