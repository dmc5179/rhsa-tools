This advisory provides fixed packages for Red Hat Linux 8.0.","The dhcp package provides the ISC Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\n(DHCP) server and relay agent.  DHCP is a protocol which allows devices to\nget their own network configuration information from a server.\nThe Internet Software Consortium has detected several potential\nvulnerabilities during an audit of the ISC DHCP server.  These\nvulnerabilities affect the minires library and may be exploitable as stack\nbuffer overflows, which could lead to remote code execution.  \nRed Hat Linux 8.0 shipped with a version of DHCP that is vulnerable to\nthese issues.  All users of DHCP are advised to upgrade to the erratum\npackages which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.  Other\nversions of Red Hat Linux and Red Hat Linux Advanced Server are based on\nversion 2 of DHCP, and are therefore not vulnerable to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
