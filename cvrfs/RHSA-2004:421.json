Malicious JavaScript could be written to utilize this flaw and\ncould allow arbitrary code execution.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0722 to\nthis issue.\nDuring a source code audit, Chris Evans discovered a buffer overflow and\ninteger overflows which affect the libpng code inside Mozilla. An attacker\ncould create a carefully crafted PNG file in such a way that it would cause\nMozilla to crash or execute arbitrary code when the image was viewed.\n(CAN-2004-0597, CAN-2004-0599)\nZen Parse reported a flaw in the POP3 capability.  A malicious POP3 server\ncould send a carefully crafted response that would cause a heap overflow\nand potentially allow execution of arbitrary code as the user running\nMozilla. (CAN-2004-0757)\nMarcel Boesch found a flaw that allows a CA certificate to be imported with\na DN the same as that of the built-in CA root certificates, which can cause\na denial of service to SSL pages, as the malicious certificate is treated\nas invalid. (CAN-2004-0758)\nMet - Martin Hassman reported a flaw in Mozilla that could allow malicious\nJavascript code to upload local files from a users machine without\nrequiring confirmation. (CAN-2004-0759)\nMindlock Security reported a flaw in ftp URI handling.  By using a NULL\ncharacter (%00) in a ftp URI, Mozilla can be confused into opening a\nresource as a different MIME type. (CAN-2004-0760)\nMozilla does not properly prevent a frame in one domain from injecting\ncontent into a frame that belongs to another domain, which facilitates\nwebsite spoofing and other attacks, also known as the frame injection\nvulnerability.  (CAN-2004-0718)\nTolga Tarhan reported a flaw that can allow a malicious webpage to use a\nredirect sequence to spoof the security lock icon that makes a webpage\nappear to be encrypted.  (CAN-2004-0761)\nJesse Ruderman reported a security issue that affects a number of browsers\nincluding Mozilla that could allow malicious websites to install arbitrary\nextensions by using interactive events to manipulate the XPInstall Security\ndialog box. (CAN-2004-0762)\nEmmanouel Kellinis discovered a caching flaw in Mozilla which allows\nmalicious websites to spoof certificates of trusted websites via\nredirects and Javascript that uses the \"onunload\" method. (CAN-2004-0763)\nMozilla allowed malicious websites to hijack the user interface via the\n\"chrome\" flag and XML User Interface Language (XUL) files. (CAN-2004-0764)\nThe cert_TestHostName function in Mozilla only checks the hostname portion\nof a certificate when the hostname portion of the URI is not a fully\nqualified domain name (FQDN).  This flaw could be used for spoofing if an\nattacker had control of machines on a default DNS search path. (CAN-2004-0765)\nAll users are advised to update to these erratum packages which contain a\nsnapshot of Mozilla 1.4.3 including backported fixes and are not vulnerable\nto these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
