Several of the NFSv4 file locking functions failed to\ncheck whether a file had been opened on the server before performing\nlocking operations on it. A local user on a system with an NFSv4 share\nmounted could possibly use this flaw to cause a denial of service or\nescalate their privileges. (CVE-2009-3726, Important)\n* permission issues were found in the megaraid_sas driver (for SAS based\nRAID controllers) in the Linux kernel. The \"dbg_lvl\" and \"poll_mode_io\"\nfiles on the sysfs file system (\"/sys/\") had world-writable permissions.\nThis could allow local, unprivileged users to change the behavior of the\ndriver. (CVE-2009-3889, CVE-2009-3939, Moderate)\nThese updated packages also fix the following bugs:\n* a problem existed with the i5000_edac driver under some topologies. In\nsome cases, this driver failed to export memory devices via sysfs,\npreventing the ibm-prtm service from starting. With this update, the memory\ndevices are accessible, allowing the ibm-prtm service to start, and\ntherefore perform SMI remediation as expected. (BZ#527421)\n* the \"/proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr\" tunable helps prevent unprivileged\nusers from creating new memory mappings below the minimum address. The\nsysctl value for mmap_min_addr could be changed by a process or user that\nhas an effective user ID (euid) of 0, even if the process or user does not\nhave the CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability. This update adds a capability check for\nthe CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability before allowing the mmap_min_addr value to be\nchanged. (BZ#534019)\nAs well, these updated packages add the following enhancements:\n* the Intel ixgbe driver was updated to upstream version 2.0.16-k2.\n(BZ#537505)\n* the InfiniBand OFED driver was updated to upstream version 1.4.1.\n(BZ#537500)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues and add these enhancements. The system must\nbe rebooted for this update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
