GStreamer Base Plug-ins is a collection of\nwell-maintained base plug-ins.\nAn integer overflow flaw which caused a heap-based buffer overflow was\ndiscovered in the Vorbis comment tags reader. An attacker could create a\ncarefully-crafted Vorbis file that would cause an application using\nGStreamer to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code if opened by a\nvictim. (CVE-2009-0586)\nAll users of gstreamer-plugins-base are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After\ninstalling this update, all applications using GStreamer (such as Totem or\nRhythmbox) must be restarted for the changes to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
