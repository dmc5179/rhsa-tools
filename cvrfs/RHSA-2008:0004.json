On sites where mod_imap was\nenabled and an imagemap file was publicly available, a cross-site scripting\nattack was possible. (CVE-2007-5000)\nA flaw was found in the mod_autoindex module. On sites where directory\nlistings are used, and the \"AddDefaultCharset\" directive has been removed\nfrom the configuration, a cross-site scripting attack was possible against\nWeb browsers which did not correctly derive the response character set\nfollowing the rules in RFC 2616. (CVE-2007-4465)\nA flaw was found in the mod_status module. On sites where mod_status was\nenabled and the status pages were publicly available, a cross-site\nscripting attack was possible. (CVE-2007-6388)\nA flaw was found in the mod_proxy_ftp module. On sites where mod_proxy_ftp\nwas enabled and a forward proxy was configured, a cross-site scripting\nattack was possible against Web browsers which did not correctly derive the\nresponse character set following the rules in RFC 2616.
