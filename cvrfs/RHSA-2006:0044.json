This\npackage includes the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and\nserver.\nAn arbitrary command execution flaw was discovered in the way scp copies\nfiles locally. It is possible for a local attacker to create a file with a\ncarefully crafted name that could execute arbitrary commands as the user\nrunning scp to copy files locally. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) assigned the name CVE-2006-0225 to this issue. \nThe following issue has also been fixed in this update:\n* If the sshd service was stopped using the sshd init script while the\nmain sshd daemon was not running, the init script would kill other sshd\nprocesses, such as the running sessions.  For example, this could happen\nwhen the 'service sshd stop' command was issued twice.\nAdditionally, this update implements auditing of user logins through the\nsystem audit service.\nAll users of openssh should upgrade to these updated packages, which\nresolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
