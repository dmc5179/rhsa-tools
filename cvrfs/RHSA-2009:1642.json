A local attacker could use this\nflaw to escalate their privileges if the log file was created as\nworld-writable and with the setuid or setgid bit set. (CVE-2009-4033)\nPlease note that this flaw was due to a Red Hat-specific patch\n(acpid-1.0.4-fd.patch) included in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 acpid\npackage.\nUsers are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which contains a\nbackported patch to correct this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
