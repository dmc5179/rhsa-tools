A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\nbase score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the\nCVE link in the References section.","Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is a visual tool for centrally\nmanaging collections of virtual servers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux\nand Microsoft Windows. This package also includes the Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Manager API, a set of scriptable commands that give\nadministrators the ability to perform queries and operations on Red Hat\nEnterprise Virtualization Manager.\nThe Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is a\nremote display protocol.\nA race condition was found in the way the SPICE plug-in for Microsoft\nInternet Explorer and the SPICE client communicated. A local attacker could\nuse this flaw to trick the plug-in and the SPICE client into communicating\nover an attacker-controlled named pipe, possibly gaining access to\nauthentication details, or resulting in privilege escalation.\n(CVE-2010-2793)\nThis updated Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager package also fixes\nseveral bugs. Documentation for these bug fixes will be available shortly\nfrom http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization_for_Servers/2.2/html/Technical_Notes/\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager users are advised to install\nthis updated package, which corrects this issue and fixes the bugs noted in\nthe Technical Notes document, linked to in the References.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
