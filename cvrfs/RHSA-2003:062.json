Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains\nthe desired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003:062"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Moderate","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated OpenSSL packages are available that fix a potential timing-based\nattack.","OpenSSL is a commercial-grade, full-featured, and open source toolkit that \nimplements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer\nSecurity (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose\ncryptography library.\nIn a paper, Brice Canvel, Alain Hiltgen, Serge Vaudenay, and Martin\nVuagnoux describe and demonstrate a timing-based attack on CBC ciphersuites\nin SSL and TLS.  An active attacker may be able to use timing observations\nto distinguish between two different error cases: cipher padding errors and\nMAC verification errors.  Over multiple connections this can leak\nsufficient information to make it possible to retrieve the plaintext of a\ncommon, fixed block.\nIn order for an attack to be sucessful, an attacker must be able to act as\na man-in-the-middle to intercept and modify multiple connections, which all\ninvolve a common fixed plaintext block (such as a password), and have good\nnetwork conditions that allow small changes in timing to be reliably\nobserved.\nThese erratum packages contain a patch provided by the OpenSSL group that\ncorrects this vulnerability.\nBecause server applications are affected by these vulnerabilities, we\nadvise users to restart all services that use OpenSSL functionality or\nalternatively reboot their systems after installing these updates.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
