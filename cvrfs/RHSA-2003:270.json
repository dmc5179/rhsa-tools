The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0690\nto this issue.\nIn addition, the session cookie generation algorithm used by KDM was\nconsidered too weak to supply a full 128 bits of entropy.  This could make\nit possible for non-authorized users, who are able to bypass any host\nrestrictions, to brute-force the session cookie and gain acess to the\ncurrent session.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0692 to this issue.\nUsers of KDE are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain security patches correcting these issues.\nRed Hat would like to thank the KDE team for notifying us of this issue and\nproviding the security patches.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
