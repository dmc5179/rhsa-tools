If an attacker is able to find an application using libxml2 that\nparses remote resources and allows them to influence the URL, then this\nflaw could be used to execute arbitrary code.  The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0110\nto this issue.\nAll users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a\nbackported fix and are not vulnerable to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
