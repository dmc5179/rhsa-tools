Like locate, slocate\nsearches through a central database (updated nightly) for files that match\na given pattern. Slocate allows you to quickly find files anywhere on your\nsystem.\nA bug was found in the way slocate scans the local filesystem. A carefully\nprepared directory structure could cause updatedb's file system scan to\nfail silently, resulting in an incomplete slocate database. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name CAN-2005-2499\nto this issue.\nAdditionally this update addresses the following issues:\n- File system type exclusions were processed only when starting updatedb \nand did not reflect file systems mounted while updatedb was running \n(for example, automounted file systems.)\n- File system type exclusions were ignored for file systems that were\nmounted to a path containing a symbolic link.\n- Databases created by slocate were owned by the slocate group even if they\nwere created by regular users.\n- The default configuration excluded /mnt/floppy, but not /media.\n- The default configuration did not exclude nfs4 file systems.\nUsers of slocate are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches and is not affected by these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
