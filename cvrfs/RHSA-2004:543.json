CUPS contains a copy of the xpdf code used\nfor parsing PDF files and is therefore affected by these bugs.  An attacker\nwho has the ability to send a malicious PDF file to a printer could cause\nCUPS to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0888 to this issue.\nWhen set up to print to a shared printer via Samba, CUPS would authenticate\nwith that shared printer using a username and password.  By default, the\nusername and password used to connect to the Samba share is written\ninto the error log file.  A local user who is able to read the error log\nfile could collect these usernames and passwords.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0923 to this issue.\nThese updated packages also include a fix that prevents some CUPS\nconfiguration files from being accidentally replaced.\nAll users of CUPS should upgrade to these updated packages, which\nresolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
