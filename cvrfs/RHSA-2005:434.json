It is possible that a malicious web\npage could execute javascript code with elevated privileges, allowing\naccess to protected data and functions. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CAN-2005-1476,\nCAN-2005-1477, CAN-2005-1531, and CAN-2005-1532 to these issues.\nPlease note that the effects of CAN-2005-1477 are mitigated by the default\nsetup, which allows only the Mozilla Update site to attempt installation of\nFirefox extensions. The Mozilla Update site has been modified to prevent\nthis attack from working. If other URLs have been manually added to the\nwhitelist, it may be possible to execute this attack.\nUsers of Firefox are advised to upgrade to this updated package which\ncontains Firefox version 1.0.4 which is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
