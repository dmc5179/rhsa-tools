It\nprovides the basic low level functionality which full fledged graphical\nuser interfaces (GUIs) such as GNOME and KDE are designed upon.\nDuring a source code audit, Chris Evans discovered several stack overflow\nflaws and an integer overflow flaw in the X.Org libXpm library used to\ndecode XPM (X PixMap) images. An attacker could create a carefully crafted\nXPM file which would cause an application to crash or potentially execute\narbitrary code if opened by a victim. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CAN-2004-0687,\nCAN-2004-0688, and CAN-2004-0692 to these issues.\nA flaw was found in the X Display Manager (XDM). XDM is shipped with Red\nHat Enterprise Linux, but is not used by default. XDM opened a chooserFd\nTCP socket even if the DisplayManager.requestPort parameter was set to 0.\nThis allowed authorized users to access a machine remotely via X, even if\nthe administrator had configured XDM to refuse such connections. Although\nXFree86 4.3.0 was not vulnerable to this issue, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3\ncontained a backported patch which introduced this flaw. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0419 to this issue.\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain\nbackported security patches to correct these and a number of other issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
