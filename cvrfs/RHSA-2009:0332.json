An attacker could use\nthese flaws to create a specially-crafted SWF file that could cause\nflash-plugin to crash, or, possibly, execute arbitrary code when the victim\nloaded a page containing the specially-crafted SWF content. (CVE-2009-0520,\nCVE-2009-0519)\nIt was discovered that Adobe Flash Player had an insecure RPATH (runtime\nlibrary search path) set in the ELF (Executable and Linking Format) header.\nA local user with write access to the directory pointed to by RPATH could\nuse this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user\nrunning Adobe Flash Player. (CVE-2009-0521)\nAll users of Adobe Flash Player should install this updated package, which\nupgrades Flash Player to version 10.0.22.87.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
