A local attacker with write permissions in the directory in\nwhich a victim is decompressing a file could remove the file being written\nand replace it with a hard link to a different file owned by the victim. \ngunzip then gives the linked file the permissions of the uncompressed file.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2005-0988 to this issue.\nA directory traversal bug was found in the way gunzip processes the -N\nflag. If a victim decompresses a file with the -N flag, gunzip fails to\nsanitize the path which could result in a file owned by the victim being\noverwritten.
