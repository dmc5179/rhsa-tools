Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,\nwhich give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability\nfrom the CVE links in the References section.","PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache\nHTTP Server.\nAn input validation flaw was discovered in the PHP session serializer. If a\nPHP script generated session variable names from untrusted user input, a\nremote attacker could use this flaw to inject an arbitrary variable into\nthe PHP session. (CVE-2010-3065)\nAn information leak flaw was discovered in the PHP var_export() function\nimplementation. If some fatal error occurred during the execution of this\nfunction (such as the exhaustion of memory or script execution time limit),\npart of the function's output was sent to the user as script output,\npossibly leading to the disclosure of sensitive information.\n(CVE-2010-2531)\nA numeric truncation error and an input validation flaw were found in the\nway the PHP utf8_decode() function decoded partial multi-byte sequences\nfor some multi-byte encodings, sending them to output without them being\nescaped. An attacker could use these flaws to perform a cross-site\nscripting attack. (CVE-2009-5016, CVE-2010-3870)\nIt was discovered that the PHP lcg_value() function used insufficient\nentropy to seed the pseudo-random number generator. A remote attacker could\npossibly use this flaw to predict values returned by the function, which\nare used to generate session identifiers by default. This update changes\nthe function's implementation to use more entropy during seeding.\n(CVE-2010-1128)\nIt was discovered that the PHP fnmatch() function did not restrict the\nlength of the pattern argument. A remote attacker could use this flaw to\ncrash the PHP interpreter where a script used fnmatch() on untrusted\nmatching patterns. (CVE-2010-1917)\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was discovered in the PHP XML-RPC\nextension. A malicious XML-RPC client or server could use this flaw to\ncrash the PHP interpreter via a specially-crafted XML-RPC request.\n(CVE-2010-0397)\nAll php users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the updated\npackages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
