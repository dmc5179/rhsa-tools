One involves\nptrace, another involves sysctl, and the last is specific to some\nIntel CPUs.  All three security holes involve local access only\n(they do not provide a hole to remote attackers without a local\naccount).  The ptrace and sysctl bugs provide local users with the\npotential to compromise the root account.  Neither has an active\nexploit available at the time of this writing.  The last security\nhole is a DOS (Denial Of Service) that does not provide access to\nthe root account but does allow any user with shell access the\nability to halt the CPU.\nAll users are strongly recommended to upgrade.\nIn addition to the security fixes, these kernels contain more\nadvanced support for the Intel Pentium 4 processors, as well as\na number of driver updates.  These updates include e100, sis900,\ncs46xx, qla1x160, qla2x00, ServeRAID, and ipvs.\nIn addition, a number of other bugs have been fixed.  Most notably,\nthe RAW I/O facility could corrupt data under certain usage patterns.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
