However, if a library has been\nfound\nin /etc/ld.so.cache, this check was not performed.  As a result, a\nmalicious user\ncould preload some /lib or /usr/lib library before SUID/SGID application\nand create or overwrite a file he did not have permissions to.\nAlso, LD_PROFILE output from SUID programs would go into /var/tmp,\nmaking it vulnerable to various link attacks.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
