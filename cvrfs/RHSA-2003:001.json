A separate\nadvisory deals with updated PostgreSQL packages for Red Hat Linux 6.2, 7,\n7.1, and 7.2.","PostgreSQL is an advanced Object-Relational database management system. \nRed Hat Linux 7.3 shipped with PostgreSQL version 7.2.1.  Red Hat Linux 8.0\nshipped with PostgreSQL version 7.2.2.\nPostgreSQL versions 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 contain a serious issue with the VACUUM\ncommand when it is run by a non-superuser.  It is possible for the system\nto prematurely remove old transaction log data (pg_clog files), which can\nresult in unrecoverable data loss.\nA number of minor security issues affect the PostgreSQL 7.2.1 packages\nshipped with Red Hat Linux 7.3 only:\n1. Buffer overflows in PostgreSQL 7.2 allow attackers to cause a denial of\nservice and possibly execute arbitrary code via long arguments to the lpad\nor rpad functions.   CAN-2002-0972\n2. Buffer overflow in the cash_words() function allows local users to cause\na denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a malformed\nargument. CAN-2002-1397\n3. Buffer overflow in the date parser allows attackers to cause a denial of\nservice and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long date string, also\nknown as a vulnerability \"in handling long datetime input.\" CAN-2002-1398\n4. Heap-based buffer overflow in the repeat() function allows attackers to\nexecute arbitrary code by causing repeat() to generate a large string.\nCAN-2002-1400\n5. Buffer overflows in the TZ and SET TIME ZONE enivronment variables allow\nlocal users to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. CAN-2002-1402\nAdditionally, buffer overflows in circle_poly, path_encode and path_add\nallow attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. Note that these overflows have been fixed in our erratum packages and\nin PostgreSQL CVS, but are not fixed in the released versions of PostgreSQL\nversion 7.2.3. CAN-2002-1401\nThe above vulnerabilities are only critical on open or shared systems\nbecause connecting to the database is required before the vulnerabilities\ncan be exploited. \nThis update also contains fixes for several other PostgreSQL bugs,\nincluding handling of pre-1970 date values in newer versions of glibc,\npossible server shutdown hangs, spinlock hangs on SMP PPC machines, and\npg_dump improperly dumping with the FULL JOIN USING clauses.\nAll users of PostgreSQL should upgrade to these errata packages containing\nPostgreSQL 7.2.3 with additional patches to correct all these issues. Note\nthat running initdb is not necessary when upgrading from 7.2.1 or 7.2.2 to\nthe packages contained in this errata.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
