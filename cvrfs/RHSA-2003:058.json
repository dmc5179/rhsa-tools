Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.

These updated packages\ncorrect a bug that caused the useradd tool to create mail spools with\nincorrect permissions.","The shadow-utils package includes programs for converting UNIX password\nfiles to the shadow password format, plus programs for managing user and\ngroup accounts. One of these programs is useradd, which is used to create\nor update new user information.\nWhen creating a user account, the version of useradd included in Red Hat\npackages creates a mail spool file with incorrectly-set group ownership.\nInstead of setting the file's group ownership to the \"mail\" group, it is\nset to the user's primary group.\nOn systems where other users share the same primary group, this would allow\nthose users to be able to read and write other user mailboxes.\nThese errata packages contain an updated patch to useradd. Where a mail\ngroup exists, mailboxes will be created with group mail having read and\nwrite permissions. Otherwise the mailbox will be created without group\nread and write permissions.\nAll users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages and also to\ncheck the /var/spool/mail directory to ensure that mailboxes have correct\npermissions.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
