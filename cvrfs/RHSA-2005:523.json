This erratum has been updated with a replacement\npackage that corrects this issue","RealPlayer is a media player that provides media playback locally and\nvia streaming. It plays RealAudio, RealVideo, MP3, 3GPP Video, Flash, SMIL\n2.0, JPEG, GIF, PNG, RealPix, RealText, and more.\nA buffer overflow bug was found in the way RealPlayer processes SMIL files.\nAn attacker could create a specially crafted SMIL file that could combine\nwith a malicious Web server to execute arbitrary code when the file was\nopened by a user. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-1766 to this issue.\nAll users of RealPlayer are advised to upgrade to this updated package,\nwhich contains RealPlayer version 10.0.5 and is not vulnerable to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
