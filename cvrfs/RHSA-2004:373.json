It provides a modular\narchitecture and ships with several modules that implement support for file\nsystems, HTTP, FTP, and others.  The extfs backends make it possible to\nimplement file systems for GNOME VFS using scripts.\nFlaws have been found in several of the GNOME VFS extfs backend scripts. \nRed Hat Enterprise Linux ships with vulnerable scripts, but they are not\nused by default.  An attacker who is able to influence a user to open a\nspecially-crafted URI using gnome-vfs could perform actions as that user.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-0494 to this issue.\nUsers of Red Hat Enterprise Linux should upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich remove these unused scripts.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
