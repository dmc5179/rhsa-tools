update for glibc is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.","The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the name service cache daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system. Without these libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.\nSecurity Fix(es):\n* glibc: buffer over-read in iconv when processing invalid multi-byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding (CVE-2019-25013)\n* glibc: regular-expression match via proceed_next_node in posix/regexec.c leads to heap-based buffer over-read (CVE-2019-9169)\n* glibc: assertion failure in ISO-2022-JP-3 gconv module related to combining characters (CVE-2021-3326)\n* glibc: iconv program can hang when invoked with the -c option (CVE-2016-10228)\n* glibc: iconv when processing invalid multi-byte input sequences fails to advance the input state, which could result in an infinite loop (CVE-2020-27618)\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\nAdditional Changes:\nFor detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Release Notes linked from the References section.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
