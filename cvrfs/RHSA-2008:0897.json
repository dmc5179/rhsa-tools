A remote attacker could\nuse this flaw to spoof a malicious reply to a DNS query. (CVE-2008-3905)\nRuby's XML document parsing module (REXML) was prone to a denial of service\nattack via XML documents with large XML entity definitions recursion. A\nspecially-crafted XML file could cause a Ruby application using the REXML\nmodule to use an excessive amount of CPU and memory. (CVE-2008-3790)\nAn insufficient \"taintness\" check flaw was discovered in Ruby's DL module,\nwhich provides direct access to the C language functions. An attacker could\nuse this flaw to bypass intended safe-level restrictions by calling\nexternal C functions with the arguments from an untrusted tainted inputs.\n(CVE-2008-3657)\nA denial of service flaw was discovered in WEBrick, Ruby's HTTP server\ntoolkit. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted HTTP request to a\nWEBrick server that would cause the server to use an excessive amount of\nCPU time. (CVE-2008-3656)\nA number of flaws were found in the safe-level restrictions in Ruby. It\nwas possible for an attacker to create a carefully crafted malicious script\nthat can allow the bypass of certain safe-level restrictions. (CVE-2008-3655)\nA denial of service flaw was found in Ruby's regular expression engine. If\na Ruby script tried to process a large amount of data via a regular\nexpression, it could cause Ruby to enter an infinite-loop and crash.\n(CVE-2008-3443)\nUsers of ruby should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
