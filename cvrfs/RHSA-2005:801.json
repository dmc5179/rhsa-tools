If a user is tricked into\nprocessing a specially crafted executable file, it may allow the execution\nof arbitrary code as the user running gdb. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-1704 to\nthis issue.\nA bug was found in the way gdb loads .gdbinit files. When a user executes\ngdb, the local directory is searched for a .gdbinit file which is then\nloaded. It is possible for a local user to execute arbitrary commands as\nthe user running gdb by placing a malicious .gdbinit file in a location\nwhere gdb may be run. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-1705 to this issue.\nAll users of gdb should upgrade to this updated package, which contains\nbackported patches that resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
