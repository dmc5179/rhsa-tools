These packages correct a bug in\npam_xauth's handling of authorization data for the root user.\n[Updated 12 March 2003]\nAdded packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES and Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux WS","The pam_xauth module is used to forward xauth information from user to user\nin applications such as the su command.\nAndreas Beck discovered that pam_xauth will forward authorization\ninformation from the root account to unprivileged users.  This could be\nused by a local attacker to gain access to an administrator's X session. \nTo exploit this vulnerability the attacker would have to get the\nadministrator, as root, to use su to access the account belonging to the\nattacker. \nUsers of pam_xauth are advised to upgrade to these errata packages which\ncontain a patch which adds ACL (access control list) functionality to\npam_xauth and disallows root forwarding by default. \nThanks to Andreas Beck for reporting this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
