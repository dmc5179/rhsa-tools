It is possible for a remote attacker to send a net-snmp agent a\nspecially crafted packet which will crash the agent. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2005-2177 to this issue.\nAn insecure temporary file usage bug was found in net-snmp's fixproc\ncommand. It is possible for a local user to modify the content of temporary\nfiles used by fixproc which can lead to arbitrary command execution. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2005-1740 to this issue.\nAdditionally the following bugs have been fixed:\n- snmpwalk no longer hangs when a non-existant pid is listed. \n- snmpd no longer segfaults due to incorrect handling of lmSensors. \n- an incorrect assignment leading to invalid values in ASN mibs has been\nfixed.\n- on systems running a 64-bit kernel, the values in /proc/net/dev no \nlonger become too large to fit in a 32-bit object. \n- the net-snmp-devel packages correctly depend on elfutils-libelf-devel.\n- large file systems are correctly handled\n- snmp daemon now reports gigabit Ethernet speeds correctly\n- fixed consistency between IP adresses and hostnames in configuration file\nAll users of net-snmp should upgrade to these updated packages, which\nresolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
