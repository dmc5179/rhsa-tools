The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2005-1454 to this issue.\nAdditionally a bug was found in the way FreeRADIUS escapes SQL data.

The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2005-1455 to this issue.\nUsers of FreeRADIUS should update to these erratum packages, which contain\nbackported patches and are not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
