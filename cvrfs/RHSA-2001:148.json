The installation process\nwill prompt you to insert the update disk when it is required, and the\ninstallation will then proceed as normal.\nIf you have already installed:\n------------------------------\nCheck the permissions on the affected files and change them as appropriate.\nOr install the upgraded redhat-release; this will change the the\npermissions during its postinstall phase.\nTo update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:\nrpm -Fvh [filenames]\nwhere [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.

They can do this by installing the updated redhat-release\npackage.","In the Red Hat Linux 7.1 Korean installation program, the 2.4.3-12 kernel\nsets the default umask for init to 000. This behavior is inherited by the\ninstallation program and causes the files to be written with world-writable\npermissions.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
