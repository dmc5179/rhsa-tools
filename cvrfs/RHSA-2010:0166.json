Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,\nwhich give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability\nfrom the CVE links in the References section.","The GnuTLS library provides support for cryptographic algorithms and for\nprotocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).\nA flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure\nSockets Layer) protocols handled session renegotiation. A man-in-the-middle\nattacker could use this flaw to prefix arbitrary plain text to a client's\nsession (for example, an HTTPS connection to a website). This could force\nthe server to process an attacker's request as if authenticated using the\nvictim's credentials. This update addresses this flaw by implementing the\nTLS Renegotiation Indication Extension, as defined in RFC 5746.\n(CVE-2009-3555)\nRefer to the following Knowledgebase article for additional details about\nthe CVE-2009-3555 flaw: http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-20491\nDan Kaminsky found that browsers could accept certificates with MD2 hash\nsignatures, even though MD2 is no longer considered a cryptographically\nstrong algorithm. This could make it easier for an attacker to create a\nmalicious certificate that would be treated as trusted by a browser. GnuTLS\nnow disables the use of the MD2 algorithm inside signatures by default.\n(CVE-2009-2409)\nUsers of GnuTLS are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. For the update to take\neffect, all applications linked to the GnuTLS library must be restarted, or\nthe system rebooted.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
