A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,\nwhich gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in\nthe References section.","The lvm2-cluster package contains support for Logical Volume Management\n(LVM) in a clustered environment.\nIt was discovered that the cluster logical volume manager daemon (clvmd)\ndid not verify the credentials of clients connecting to its control UNIX\nabstract socket, allowing local, unprivileged users to send control\ncommands that were intended to only be available to the privileged root\nuser. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to cause clvmd to exit,\nor request clvmd to activate, deactivate, or reload any logical volume on\nthe local system or another system in the cluster. (CVE-2010-2526)\nNote: This update changes clvmd to use a pathname-based socket rather than\nan abstract socket. As such, the lvm2 update RHBA-2010:0569, which changes\nLVM to also use this pathname-based socket, must also be installed for LVM\nto be able to communicate with the updated clvmd.\nAll lvm2-cluster users should upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the\nupdated package, clvmd must be restarted for the update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
