The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0940 to this issue.\nmod_digest does not properly verify the nonce of a client response by using\na AuthNonce secret. This could allow a malicious user who is able to sniff\nnetwork traffic to conduct a replay attack against a website using Digest\nprotection. Note that mod_digest implements an older version of the MD5\nDigest Authentication specification which is known not to work with modern\nbrowsers. This issue does not affect mod_auth_digest. (CAN-2003-0987)\nThe mod_ssl module, when using the \"SSLCipherSuite\" directive in directory\nor location context, allows remote clients to bypass intended restrictions\nby using any cipher suite that is allowed by the virtual host\nconfiguration.  (CAN-2004-0885)\nUsers of Stronghold 4 cross-platform are advised to update to these errata\nversions, which contain backported security fixes and are not vulnerable to\nthese issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
