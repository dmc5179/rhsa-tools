Virtualization allows users\nto run guest operating systems in virtual machines on top of a host\noperating system.\nThe pyGrub boot loader did not honor the \"password\" option in the grub.conf\nfile for para-virtualized guests. Users with access to a guest's console\ncould use this flaw to bypass intended access restrictions and boot the\nguest with arbitrary kernel boot options, allowing them to get root\nprivileges in the guest's operating system. With this update, pyGrub\ncorrectly honors the \"password\" option in grub.conf for para-virtualized\nguests. (CVE-2009-3525)\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n* rebooting para-virtualized guests sometimes caused those guests to crash\ndue to a race condition in the xend node control daemon. This update fixes\nthis race condition so that rebooting guests no longer potentially causes\nthem to crash and fail to reboot. (BZ#525141)\n* due to a race condition in the xend daemon, a guest could disappear from\nthe list of running guests following a reboot, even though the guest\nrebooted successfully and was running. This update fixes this race\ncondition so that guests always reappear in the guest list following a\nreboot. (BZ#525143)\n* attempting to use PCI pass-through to para-virtualized guests on certain\nkernels failed with a \"Function not implemented\" error message. As a\nresult, users requiring PCI pass-through on para-virtualized guests were\nnot able to update the xen packages without also updating the kernel and\nthus requiring a reboot. These updated packages enable PCI pass-through for\npara-virtualized guests so that users do not need to upgrade the kernel in\norder to take advantage of PCI pass-through functionality. (BZ#525149)\nAll Xen users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues. After installing the updated\npackages, the xend service must be restarted for this update to take\neffect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
