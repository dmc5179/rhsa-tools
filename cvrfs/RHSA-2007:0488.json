(CVE-2006-7203, Important)\n* a flaw in the IPv4 forwarding base that allowed a local user to cause an\nout-of-bounds access. (CVE-2007-2172, Important)\n* a flaw in the PPP over Ethernet implementation that allowed a local user\nto cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by creating a socket\nusing connect and then releasing it before the PPPIOCGCHAN ioctl has been\ncalled. (CVE-2007-2525, Important)\n* a flaw in the fput ioctl handling of 32-bit applications running on\n64-bit platforms that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service\n(panic). (CVE-2007-0773, Important)\n* a flaw in the NFS locking daemon that allowed a local user to cause\ndenial of service (deadlock). (CVE-2006-5158, Moderate)\n* a flaw in the sysfs_readdir function that allowed a local user to cause a\ndenial of service by dereferencing a NULL pointer. (CVE-2007-3104, Moderate)\n* a flaw in the core-dump handling that allowed a local user to create core\ndumps from unreadable binaries via PT_INTERP. (CVE-2007-0958, Low) \n* a flaw in the Bluetooth subsystem that allowed a local user to trigger an\ninformation leak. (CVE-2007-1353, Low)\nIn addition, the following bugs were addressed:\n* the NFS could recurse on the same spinlock. Also, NFS, under certain\nconditions, did not completely clean up Posix locks on a file close,\nleading to mount failures.\n* the 32bit compatibility didn't return to userspace correct values for the\nrt_sigtimedwait system call.\n* the count for unused inodes could be incorrect at times, resulting in\ndirty data not being written to disk in a timely manner.\n* the cciss driver had an incorrect disk size calculation (off-by-one\nerror) which prevented disk dumps.\nRed Hat would like to thank Ilja van Sprundel and the OpenVZ Linux kernel\nteam for reporting issues fixed in this erratum.\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users are advised to upgrade their kernels\nto the packages associated with their machine architectures and\nconfigurations as listed in this erratum.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
