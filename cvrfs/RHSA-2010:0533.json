A local\nuser could create a specially-crafted request that would cause the pcscd\ndaemon to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-0407,\nCVE-2009-4901)\nUsers of pcsc-lite should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\na backported patch to correct these issues. After installing this update,\nthe pcscd daemon will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
