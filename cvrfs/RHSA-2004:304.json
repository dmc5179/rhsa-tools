These updates correct a bug in the pam_lastlog\nmodule which prevented it from properly manipulating the /var/log/lastlog\nentry for users with very high user IDs.\nThe pam_wheel module is used to restrict access to a particular service\nbased on group membership.  If the pam_wheel module was used with the\n\"trust\" option enabled, but without the \"use_uid\" option, any local\nuser would be able to spoof the username returned by getlogin(). The user\ncould therefore gain access to a superuser account without supplying a\npassword.  In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, pam_wheel is not used by\ndefault.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\nhas assigned the name CAN-2003-0388 to this issue.\nWhen manipulating the entry in /var/log/lastlog, which corresponds to a\ngiven user, the pam_lastlog module calculates the location of the entry by\nmultiplying the UID and the length of an entry in the file.  On some\nsystems, the result of this calculation would mistakenly be truncated to 32\nbits for users with sufficiently high UIDs.\nAll users of pam should upgrade to these updated packages, which\nresolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
