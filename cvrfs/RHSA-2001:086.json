The original\npackages detected the availability of syscalls present in kernels newer\nthan 2.2. Red Hat Linux 5.2 has a 2.0 kernel, and users will experience\nvarious problems when these syscalls are used. This release removes the\ndetection of these syscalls from the autoconf script.","The Samba configuration used in Red Hat Linux logs operations into\n[remotenetbiosname].log. By sending an invalid NetBIOS name, Samba could be\nfooled to write its log in unintended and inappropriate locations. This can\nbe especially dangerous if combined with a symlink created by a local user.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
