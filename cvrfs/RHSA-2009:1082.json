The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) allows\nusers to print and manage printing-related tasks over a network. \nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the CUPS IPP routine, used for\nprocessing incoming IPP requests for the CUPS scheduler. An attacker could\nuse this flaw to send specially-crafted IPP requests that would crash the\ncupsd daemon. (CVE-2009-0949)\nRed Hat would like to thank Anibal Sacco from Core Security Technologies\nfor reporting this issue.\nUsers of cups are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing this\nupdate, the cupsd daemon will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
