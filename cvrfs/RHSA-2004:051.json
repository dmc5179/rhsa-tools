Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of\nup2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be\ndownloaded directly from the RHN website:\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2004:051"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Important","type":"Impact"}},"acknowledgments":{"acknowledgment":{"description":"Red Hat would like to thank Niels Heinen for reporting this issue."}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["New mutt packages that fix a remotely-triggerable crash in the menu drawing\ncode are now available.","Mutt is a text-mode mail user agent.\nA bug was found in the index menu code in versions of mutt.
