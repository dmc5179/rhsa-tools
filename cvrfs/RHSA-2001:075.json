Each service has its own specific configuration file for\nXinetd; the files are located in the /etc/xinetd.d directory.\nPreviously, xinetd ran with umask 0, which meant that applications using\nthe xinetd umask that did not set permissions themselves created\nworld-writable files. This update sets the default umask to 022. \nAlso, the web interface for linuxconf did not work in Red Hat Linux 7.1.\nOther minor issues have also been addressed.\nUsers of xinetd should upgrade to this updated package, which resolves\nthese issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
