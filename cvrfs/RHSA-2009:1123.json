GStreamer Good Plug-ins is a collection of\nwell-supported, good quality GStreamer plug-ins.\nMultiple integer overflow flaws, that could lead to a buffer overflow, were\nfound in the GStreamer Good Plug-ins PNG decoding handler. An attacker\ncould create a specially-crafted PNG file that would cause an application\nusing the GStreamer Good Plug-ins library to crash or, potentially, execute\narbitrary code as the user running the application when parsed.\n(CVE-2009-1932)\nAll users of gstreamer-plugins-good are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain a backported patch to correct these issues. After\ninstalling the update, all applications using GStreamer Good Plug-ins (such\nas some media playing applications) must be restarted for the changes to\ntake effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
