If an attacker is able to cause a server application to process a\nspecially crafted image file, it may be possible to execute arbitrary code\nas the user running the Java Virtual Machine. (CVE-2007-2788,\nCVE-2007-2789, CVE-2007-3004)\nA denial of service flaw was discovered in the Java Applet Viewer. An\nuntrusted Java applet could cause the Java Virtual Machine to become\nunresponsive. Please note that the BEA WebLogic JRockit 1.5.0_11 does not\nship with a browser plug-in and therefore this issue could only be\ntriggered by a user running the \"appletviewer\" application. (CVE-2007-3005)\nA cross site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the Javadoc tool. An\nattacker could inject arbitrary content into a Javadoc generated HTML\ndocumentation page, possibly tricking a user or stealing sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2007-3503)\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way the JSSE component processed\nSSL/TLS handshake requests. A remote attacker able to connect to a JSSE\nenabled service could send a specially crafted handshake which would cause\nthe Java Runtime Environment to stop responding to future requests. \n(CVE-2007-3698)\nA flaw was found in the way the Java Runtime Environment processes font\ndata. An applet viewed via the 'appletviewer' application could elevate\nits privileges, allowing the applet to perform actions with the same\npermissions as the user running the \"appletviewer\" application. It may also\nbe possible to crash a server application which processes untrusted font\ninformation from a third party. (CVE-2007-4381)\nAll users of java-bea-1.5.0 should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain the BEA WebLogic JRockit 1.5.0_11 release that resolves these\nissues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
