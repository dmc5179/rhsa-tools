Gdm allows you to log into your system with\nthe X Window System running and supports running several different X\nsessions on your local machine at the same time.\nMarcus Meissner discovered a race condition issue in the way Gdm modifies\nthe permissions on the .ICEauthority file. A local attacker could exploit\nthis flaw to gain privileges. Due to the nature of the flaw, however, a\nsuccessful exploitation was unlikely. (CVE-2006-1057)\nThis erratum also includes a bug fix to correct the pam configuration for\nthe audit system.\nAll users of gdm should upgrade to this updated package, which contains\nbackported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
