If a client connection is referred to a different server, it is\npossible that the referred connection will not be encrypted even if the\nclient has \"ssl start_tls\" in its ldap.conf file. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name CAN-2005-2069\nto this issue.\nA bug was also found in the way certain OpenLDAP authentication schemes\nstore hashed passwords. A remote attacker could re-use a hashed password to\ngain access to unauthorized resources. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project has assigned the name CAN-2004-0823 to this issue.\nAll users of OpenLDAP and nss_ldap are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain backported fixes that resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
