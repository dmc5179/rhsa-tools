(CVE-2008-4552)\nThis updated package also fixes the following bugs:\n* the \"LOCKD_TCPPORT\" and \"LOCKD_UDPPORT\" options in \"/etc/sysconfig/nfs\"\nwere not honored: the lockd daemon continued to use random ports. With this\nupdate, these options are honored. (BZ#434795)\n* it was not possible to mount NFS file systems from a system that has\nthe \"/etc/\" directory mounted on a read-only file system (this could occur\non systems with an NFS-mounted root file system). With this update, it is\npossible to mount NFS file systems from a system that has \"/etc/\" mounted\non a read-only file system. (BZ#450646)\n* arguments specified by \"STATDARG=\" in \"/etc/sysconfig/nfs\" were removed\nby the nfslock init script, meaning the arguments specified were never\npassed to rpc.statd. With this update, the nfslock init script no longer\nremoves these arguments. (BZ#459591)\n* when mounting an NFS file system from a host not specified in the NFS\nserver's \"/etc/exports\" file, a misleading \"unknown host\" error was logged\non the server (the hostname lookup did not fail). With this update, a\nclearer error message is provided for these situations. (BZ#463578)\n* the nhfsstone benchmark utility did not work with NFS version 3 and 4.\nThis update adds support to nhfsstone for NFS version 3 and 4. The new\nnhfsstone \"-2\", \"-3\", and \"-4\" options are used to select an NFS version\n(similar to nfsstat(8)). (BZ#465933)\n* the exportfs(8) manual page contained a spelling mistake, \"djando\", in\nthe EXAMPLES section. (BZ#474848)\n* in some situations the NFS server incorrectly refused mounts to hosts\nthat had a host alias in a NIS netgroup. (BZ#478952)\n* in some situations the NFS client used its cache, rather than using\nthe latest version of a file or directory from a given export. This update\nadds a new mount option, \"lookupcache=\", which allows the NFS client to\ncontrol how it caches files and directories. Note: The Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux 5.4 kernel update (the fourth regular update) must be installed in\norder to use the \"lookupcache=\" option. Also, \"lookupcache=\" is currently\nonly available for NFS version 3. Support for NFS version 4 may be\nintroduced in future Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 updates. Refer to Red Hat\nBugzilla #511312 for further information. (BZ#489335)\nUsers of nfs-utils should upgrade to this updated package, which contains\nbackported patches to correct these issues. After installing this update,\nthe nfs service will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
