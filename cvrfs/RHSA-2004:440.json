A carefully created archive could\nallow an attacker to execute arbitrary code when a victim extracts or tests\nthe archive.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0769 to this issue.\nBuffer overflows were discovered in the command line processing of all\nversions of lha up to and including version 1.14.  If a malicious user can\ntrick a victim into passing a specially crafted command line to the lha\ncommand, it is possible that arbitrary code could be executed.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the\nnames CAN-2004-0771 and CAN-2004-0694 to these issues.\nThomas Biege discovered a shell meta character command execution\nvulnerability in all versions of lha up to and including 1.14.  An attacker\ncould create a directory with shell meta characters in its name which could\nlead to arbitrary command execution.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0745 to\nthis issue.\nUsers of lha should update to this updated package which contains\nbackported patches and is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
