(CVE-2007-5745,\nCVE-2007-5747)\nA heap overflow flaw was found in the EMF parser. An attacker could create\na carefully crafted EMF file that could cause OpenOffice.org to crash or\npossibly execute arbitrary code if the malicious EMF image was added to a\ndocument or if a document containing the malicious EMF file was opened by a\nvictim. (CVE-2007-5746)\nA heap overflow flaw was found in the OLE Structured Storage file parser.\n(OLE Structured Storage is a format used by Microsoft Office documents.) An\nattacker could create a carefully crafted OLE file that could cause\nOpenOffice.org to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code if the file was\nopened by a victim. (CVE-2008-0320)\nAll users of OpenOffice.org are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain backported fixes to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
