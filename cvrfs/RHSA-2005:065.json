If a user has Java enabled in Konqueror and\nvisits a malicious website, the website could run a carefully crafted\nJava-applet and obtain escalated privileges allowing reading and writing of\narbitrary files with the privileges of the victim.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-1145 to this issue.\nA flaw was discovered in the FTP kioslave.  KDE applications such as\nKonqueror could be forced to execute arbitrary FTP commands via a carefully\ncrafted ftp URL.  The URL could also be crafted in such a way as to send an\narbitrary email via SMTP.  An attacker could make use of this flaw if a\nvictim visits a malicious web site. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project has assigned the name CAN-2004-1165 to this issue.\nUsers should update to these erratum packages which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
