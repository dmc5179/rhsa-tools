The usage of uninitialised variables in\nthe pnmtopng code allows an attacker to change stack contents when\nconverting to PNG files with pnmtopng using the '-trans' option. This may\nallow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project assigned the name CAN-2005-2978 to this issue.\nAll users of netpbm should upgrade to the updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to resolve this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
