Berrange discovered that the hypervisor's para-virtualized\nframebuffer (PVFB) backend failed to validate the format of messages\nserving to update the contents of the framebuffer. This could allow a\nmalicious user to cause a denial of service, or compromise the privileged\ndomain (Dom0). (CVE-2008-1944)\nMarkus Armbruster discovered that the hypervisor's para-virtualized\nframebuffer (PVFB) backend failed to validate the frontend's framebuffer\ndescription. This could allow a malicious user to cause a denial of\nservice, or to use a specially crafted frontend to compromise the\nprivileged domain (Dom0). (CVE-2008-1943)\nChris Wright discovered a security vulnerability in the QEMU block format\nauto-detection, when running fully-virtualized guests. Such\nfully-virtualized guests, with a raw formatted disk image, were able\nto write a header to that disk image describing another format. This could\nallow such guests to read arbitrary files in their hypervisor's host.\n(CVE-2008-2004)\nIan Jackson discovered a security vulnerability in the QEMU block device\ndrivers backend. A guest operating system could issue a block device\nrequest and read or write arbitrary memory locations, which could lead to\nprivilege escalation. (CVE-2008-0928)\nTavis Ormandy found that QEMU did not perform adequate sanity-checking of\ndata received via the \"net socket listen\" option. A malicious local\nadministrator of a guest domain could trigger this flaw to potentially\nexecute arbitrary code outside of the domain. (CVE-2007-5730)\nSteve Kemp discovered that the xenbaked daemon and the XenMon utility\ncommunicated via an insecure temporary file. A malicious local\nadministrator of a guest domain could perform a symbolic link attack,\ncausing arbitrary files to be truncated. (CVE-2007-3919)\nAs well, in the previous xen packages, it was possible for Dom0 to fail to\nflush data from a fully-virtualized guest to disk, even if the guest\nexplicitly requested the flush. This could cause data integrity problems on\nthe guest. In these updated packages, Dom0 always respects the request to\nflush to disk.\nUsers of xen are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\nresolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
