An attacker\ncould create a text file containing a specially crafted modeline which\ncould cause arbitrary command execution when viewed by a victim using VIM. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-1138 to this issue.  Please note that this issue only affects\nusers who have modelines and filetype plugins enabled, which is not the\ndefault.  \nThe Debian Security Audit Project discovered an insecure temporary file\nusage in VIM.  A local user could overwrite or create files as a different\nuser who happens to run one of the the vulnerable utilities.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2005-0069 to this issue. \nAll users of VIM are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages,\nwhich contain backported patches for these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
