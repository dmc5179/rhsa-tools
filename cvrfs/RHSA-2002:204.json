Two vulnerabilities\nhave been found that affect SquirrelMail version 1.2.7 and earlier.\nCross-site scripting vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to execute\nscript as other web users via addressbook.php, options.php, search.php, or\nhelp.php.\nIt is possible for remote attackers to determine the absolute pathname of\nthe options.php script via a malformed optpage file argument, which\ngenerates an error message when the file cannot be included in the script.\nRed Hat Linux 8 shipped with SquirrelMail version 1.2.7 and is therefore\nvulnerable to these issues. \nAll users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages containing\nSquirrelMail version 1.2.8 which is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
