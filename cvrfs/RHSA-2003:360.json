Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of\nup2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be\ndownloaded directly from the RHN website:\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt\nAfter the errata packages are installed, restart the Web service by running\nthe following command as root:\n/sbin/service httpd restart","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003:360"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Low","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated Apache packages that fix a minor security issue are now available\nfor Red Hat Enterprise Linux.","The Apache HTTP server is a powerful, full-featured, efficient, and\nfreely-available Web server.\nAn issue in the handling of regular expressions from configuration files\nwas discovered in releases of the Apache HTTP Server version 1.3 prior to\n1.3.29. To exploit this issue an attacker would need to have the ability\nto write to Apache configuration files such as .htaccess or httpd.conf. A\ncarefully-crafted configuration file can cause an exploitable buffer\noverflow and would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the\ncontext of the server (in default configurations as the 'apache' user).\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2003-0542 to this issue.\nThis update also includes an alternative version of the httpd binary which\nsupports setting the MaxClients configuration directive to values above 256.\nAll users of the Apache HTTP Web Server are advised to upgrade to the\napplicable errata packages, which contain back-ported fixes correcting\nthe above security issue.\nNote that the instructions in the \"Solution\" section of this errata contain\nadditional steps required to complete the upgrade process.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
