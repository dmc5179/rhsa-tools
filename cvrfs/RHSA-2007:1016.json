(CVE-2007-5398)\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Samba authenticates\nusers. A remote unauthenticated user could trigger this flaw to cause the\nSamba server to crash. Careful analysis of this flaw has determined that\narbitrary code execution is not possible, and under most circumstances will\nnot result in a crash of the Samba server. (CVE-2007-4572)\nA flaw was found in the way Samba assigned group IDs under certain\nconditions. If the \"winbind nss info\" parameter in smb.conf is set to\neither \"sfu\" or \"rfc2307\", Samba users are incorrectly assigned the group\nID of 0. (CVE-2007-4138)\nRed Hat would like to thank Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research, Rick King,\nand the Samba developers for responsibly disclosing these issues.\nAll Samba users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
