It is\npossible that a remote attacker could send a specially crafted message to a\nGaim client, causing it to crash. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0965 to this issue.\nA bug was found in several of gaim's IRC processing functions. These\nfunctions fail to properly remove various markup tags within an IRC\nmessage. It is possible that a remote attacker could send a specially\ncrafted message to a Gaim client connected to an IRC server, causing it to\ncrash. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2005-0966 to this issue.\nA bug was found in gaim's Jabber message parser. It is possible for a\nremote Jabber user to send a specially crafted message to a Gaim client,\ncausing it to crash. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0967 to this issue.\nIn addition to these denial of service issues, multiple minor upstream\nbugfixes are included in this update.\nUsers of Gaim are advised to upgrade to this updated package which contains\nGaim version 1.2.1 and is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
