Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains\nthe desired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2002:132"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Moderate","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["A locally exploitable vulnerability is present in the util-linux package\nwhich shipped with Red Hat Linux.\n[Updated 8 July 2003]\nAdded packages for Red Hat Linux on IBM iSeries and pSeries systems.","The util-linux package contains a large variety of low-level system\nutilities that are necessary for a Linux system to function. The chfn\nutility included in this package allows users to modify personal\ninformation stored in the system-wide password file, /etc/passwd. In order\nto modify this file, this application is installed setuid root.\nUnder certain conditions, a carefully crafted attack sequence can be\nperformed to exploit a complex file locking and modification race present\nin this utility allowing changes to be made to /etc/passwd.  \nIn order to successfully exploit the vulnerability and perform privilege\nescalation there is a need for minimal administrator interaction. \nAdditionally, the password file must be over 4 kilobytes, and the local\nattackers entry must not be in the last 4 kilobytes of the password file.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0638 to this issue.\nAn interim workaround is to remove setuid flags from /usr/bin/chfn and\n/usr/bin/chsh.  All users of Red Hat Linux should update the packages\ncontained in this erratum, which are patched to correct this vulnerability.\nMany thanks to Michal Zalewski of Bindview for alerting us to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
