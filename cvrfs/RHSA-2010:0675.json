If a local user were authorized by the\nsudoers file to perform their sudo commands with the privileges of a\nspecified user and group, they could use this flaw to run those commands\nwith the privileges of either an arbitrary user or group on the system.\n(CVE-2010-2956)\nRed Hat would like to thank Markus Wuethrich of Swiss Post - PostFinance\nfor reporting this issue.\nUsers of sudo should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a\nbackported patch to correct this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
