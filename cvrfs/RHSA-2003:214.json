Due to a compilation error this did not\nhappen, and tcpdump would run as root unless the '-U' flag was specified.\nUsers of tcpdump are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which\nare compiled so that by default tcpdump will drop privileges to the\n'pcap' user.\nThe BGP decoding routines in tcpdump before 3.6.2 used incorrect bounds\nchecking when copying data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial\nof service and possibly execute arbitrary code (as the 'pcap' user).\nThe RADIUS decoder in tcpdump 3.6.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to\ncause a denial of service (crash) via an invalid RADIUS packet with a\nheader length field of 0. This causes tcpdump to generate data within an\ninfinite loop.\nA vulnerability in tcpdump before 3.7.2 is related to an inability to\nhandle unknown RADIUS attributes properly, and allows remote attackers to\ncause a denial of service (infinite loop).\nThe ISAKMP parser in tcpdump 3.6 through 3.7.1 allows remote attackers to\ncause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a malformed ISAKMP packet\nto UDP port 500, causing tcpdump to enter an infinite loop.\nVersions of tcpdump up to and including 3.6.2 have a buffer overflow that\ncan be triggered when tracing the network by a bad NFS packet. This issue\nwas found by David Woodhouse of Red Hat.\nUsers of tcpdump are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which\ncontain patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
