These\npackages include the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and\nserver.\nA flaw was found in the way the ssh server wrote account names to the audit\nsubsystem. An attacker could inject strings containing parts of audit\nmessages, which could possibly mislead or confuse audit log parsing tools.\n(CVE-2007-3102)\nA flaw was found in the way the OpenSSH server processes GSSAPI\nauthentication requests. When GSSAPI authentication was enabled in the\nOpenSSH server, a remote attacker was potentially able to determine if a\nusername is valid. (CVE-2006-5052)\nThe following bugs in SELinux MLS (Multi-Level Security) support has also\nbeen fixed in this update:\n* It was sometimes not possible to select a SELinux role and level when\nlogging in using ssh.\n* If the user obtained a non-default SELinux role or level, the role change\nwas not recorded in the audit subsystem.\n* In some cases, on labeled networks, sshd allowed logins from level ranges\nit should not allow.\nThe updated packages also contain experimental support for using private\nkeys stored in PKCS#11 tokens for client authentication. The support is\nprovided through the NSS (Network Security Services) library.\nAll users of openssh should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
