This\npackage includes the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and\nserver.\nMark Dowd discovered a signal handler race condition in the OpenSSH sshd\nserver. A remote attacker could possibly leverage this flaw to cause a\ndenial of service (crash). (CVE-2006-5051) The OpenSSH project believes the\nlikelihood of successful exploitation leading to arbitrary code execution\nappears remote. However, the Red Hat Security Response Team have not yet\nbeen able to verify this claim due to lack of upstream vulnerability\ninformation. We are therefore including a fix for this flaw and have rated\nit important security severity in the event our continued investigation\nfinds this issue to be exploitable.\nTavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team discovered a denial of service\nbug in the OpenSSH sshd server. A remote attacker can send a specially\ncrafted SSH-1 request to the server causing sshd to consume a large\nquantity of CPU resources. (CVE-2006-4924)\nAn arbitrary command execution flaw was discovered in the way scp copies\nfiles locally. It is possible for a local attacker to create a file with a\ncarefully crafted name that could execute arbitrary commands as the user\nrunning scp to copy files locally. (CVE-2006-0225)\nThe SSH daemon, when restricting host access by numeric IP addresses and\nwith VerifyReverseMapping disabled, allows remote attackers to bypass\n\"from=\" and \"user@host\" address restrictions by connecting to a host from a\nsystem whose reverse DNS hostname contains the numeric IP address.\n(CVE-2003-0386)\nAll users of openssh should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches that resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
