A\nremote attacker able to pass arbitrary input to a PHP script using mbstring\nconversion functions could cause the PHP interpreter to crash or,\npossibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-5557)\nA flaw was found in the handling of the \"mbstring.func_overload\"\nconfiguration setting. A value set for one virtual host, or in a user's\n.htaccess file, was incorrectly applied to other virtual hosts on the same\nserver, causing the handling of multibyte character strings to not work\ncorrectly. (CVE-2009-0754)\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in PHP's imageloadfont function.  If a PHP\nscript allowed a remote attacker to load a carefully crafted font file, it\ncould cause the PHP interpreter to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2008-3658)\nA flaw was found in the way PHP handled certain file extensions when\nrunning in FastCGI mode. If the PHP interpreter was being executed via\nFastCGI, a remote attacker could create a request which would cause the PHP\ninterpreter to crash. (CVE-2008-3660)\nA memory disclosure flaw was found in the PHP gd extension's imagerotate\nfunction. A remote attacker able to pass arbitrary values as the\n\"background color\" argument of the function could, possibly, view portions\nof the PHP interpreter's memory. (CVE-2008-5498)\nA cross-site scripting flaw was found in a way PHP reported errors for\ninvalid cookies. If the PHP interpreter had \"display_errors\" enabled, a\nremote attacker able to set a specially-crafted cookie on a victim's system\ncould possibly inject arbitrary HTML into an error message generated by\nPHP. (CVE-2008-5814)\nAll php users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve these issues. The httpd web server\nmust be restarted for the changes to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
