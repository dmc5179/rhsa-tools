The issue\nCAN-2005-0209 was actually fixed by RHSA-2005:420.  No changes have been\nmade to the packages associated with this advisory.","The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.\nA flaw in the fib_seq_start function was discovered. A local user could use\nthis flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) via /proc/net/route.\n(CAN-2005-1041)\nA flaw in the tmpfs file system was discovered. A local user could use this\nflaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CAN-2005-0977)\nAn integer overflow flaw was found when writing to a sysfs file. A local\nuser could use this flaw to overwrite kernel memory, causing a denial of\nservice (system crash) or arbitrary code execution. (CAN-2005-0867)\nKeith Owens reported a flaw in the Itanium unw_unwind_to_user function. A\nlocal user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash)\non Itanium architectures. (CAN-2005-0135)\nA flaw in the NFS client O_DIRECT error case handling was discovered. A\nlocal user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CAN-2005-0207)\nA small memory leak when defragmenting local packets was discovered that\naffected the Linux 2.6 kernel netfilter subsystem.  A local user could send\na large number of carefully crafted fragments leading to memory exhaustion\n(CAN-2005-0210)\nA flaw was discovered in the Linux PPP driver. On systems allowing remote\nusers to connect to a server using ppp, a remote client could cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CAN-2005-0384)\nA flaw was discovered in the ext2 file system code. When a new directory is\ncreated, the ext2 block written to disk is not initialized, which could\nlead to an information leak if a disk image is made available to\nunprivileged users. (CAN-2005-0400)\nA flaw in fragment queuing was discovered that affected the Linux kernel\nnetfilter subsystem. On systems configured to filter or process network\npackets (e.g. firewalling), a remote attacker could send a carefully\ncrafted set of fragmented packets to a machine and cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). In order to sucessfully exploit this flaw, the\nattacker would need to know or guess some aspects of the firewall ruleset\non the target system. (CAN-2005-0449)\nA number of flaws were found in the Linux 2.6 kernel. A local user could\nuse these flaws to read kernel memory or cause a denial of service (crash).\n(CAN-2005-0529, CAN-2005-0530, CAN-2005-0531)\nAn integer overflow in sys_epoll_wait in eventpoll.c was discovered. A\nlocal user could use this flaw to overwrite low kernel memory. This memory\nis usually unused, not usually resulting in a security consequence.\n(CAN-2005-0736)\nA flaw when freeing a pointer in load_elf_library was discovered. A local\nuser could potentially use this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash).\n(CAN-2005-0749)\nA flaw was discovered in the bluetooth driver system. On systems where the\nbluetooth modules are loaded, a local user could use this flaw to gain\nelevated (root) privileges. (CAN-2005-0750)\nA race condition was discovered that affected the Radeon DRI driver. A\nlocal user who has DRI privileges on a Radeon graphics card may be able to\nuse this flaw to gain root privileges. (CAN-2005-0767)\nMultiple range checking flaws were discovered in the iso9660 file system\nhandler. An attacker could create a malicious file system image which would\ncause a denial or service or potentially execute arbitrary code if mounted.\n(CAN-2005-0815)\nA flaw was discovered when setting line discipline on a serial tty. A local\nuser may be able to use this flaw to inject mouse movements or keystrokes\nwhen another user is logged in. (CAN-2005-0839)\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users are advised to upgrade their kernels\nto the packages associated with their machine architectures and\nconfigurations as listed in this erratum.\nPlease note that","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
