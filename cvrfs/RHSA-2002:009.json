This bug can allow a malicious attacker to cause arbitrary\ncommands embedded in a URL to be executed on the users system upon\nattempting to view the URL.","The purpose of this release is to fix a security bug with the\ntreatment of quotes in the URL-handling code. The bug allows a\nmalicious sender to embed commands in a URL. This bug is present\nin all versions of UNIX Pine 4.43 or earlier.\nExample: A URL constructed as:\nhttp://www.somewhere.com/'&touch${IFS}/tmp/foo${IFS}/tmp/bar'\nwould cause the files /tmp/foo and /tmp/bar to be created on the\nuser's machine if the URL is viewed.\nThanks to zen-parse for discovering and reporting this problem.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0014 to this issue.\nAll users of Pine are urged to upgrade to this erratum release.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
