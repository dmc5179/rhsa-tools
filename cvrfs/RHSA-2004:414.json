An attacker could create a\ncarefully crafted BMP file in such a way that it would cause an application\nlinked with Qt to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code when the file\nwas opened by a victim.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0691 to this issue.\nAdditionally, various flaws were discovered in the GIF, XPM, and JPEG\ndecoders in Qt versions prior to 3.3.3. An attacker could create carefully\ncrafted image files in such a way that it could cause an application linked\nagainst Qt to crash when the file was opened by a victim.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the\nnames CAN-2004-0692 and CAN-2004-0693 to these issues.\nUsers of Qt should update to these updated packages which contain\nbackported patches and are not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
