A number of issues have been found in versions of these projects:\nResearchers discovered a timing attack on RSA keys that affects OpenSSL.  \nA local or remote attacker could use this attack to obtain the server's\nprivate key by determining factors using timing differences on (1) the\nnumber of extra reductions during Montgomery reduction and (2) the use of\ndifferent integer multiplication algorithms (Karatsuba and normal).\nStronghold does not enable RSA blinding by default and is, therefore,\nvulnerable to this attack.\nThe SSL and TLS components for OpenSSL allow remote attackers to perform an\nunauthorized RSA private key operation via a modified Bleichenbacher\nattack. This attack (also known as the Klima-Pokorny-Rosa attack) uses a\nlarge number of SSL or TLS connections, using PKCS #1 v1.5 padding, and\ncauses OpenSSL to leak information regarding the relationship between\nciphertext and the associated plaintext.\nVersions of Apache 1.3 before 1.3.25 do not filter terminal escape\nsequences from access logs, which could make it easier for attackers to\ninsert those sequences into terminal emulators containing vulnerabilities\nrelated to escape sequences.\nThese erratum packages contain a patch provided by the OpenSSL group that\nenables RSA blinding by default, thereby protecting against the\nKlima-Pokorny-Rosa attack, and a patch to filter escape sequences from\nApache access logs.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
