An attacker could execute arbitrary\ncode on behalf of the user running gnome-system-monitor by executing a\nprocess and mapping a file with a specially crafted name into the\nprocesses' address space. (CVE-2007-0235)\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n* when a version of libgtop2 compiled to run on a 32-bit architecture was\nused to inspect a process running in 64-bit mode, it failed to report\ncertain information regarding address space mapping correctly.\nAll users of gnome-system-monitor are advised to upgrade to this updated\nlibgtop2 package, which contains backported patches that resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
