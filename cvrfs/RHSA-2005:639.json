Kopete is a KDE instant messenger which supports a number of\nprotocols including ICQ, MSN, Yahoo, Jabber, and Gadu-Gadu.\nMultiple integer overflow flaws were found in the way Kopete processes\nGadu-Gadu messages. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted\nGadu-Gadu message which would cause Kopete to crash or possibly execute\narbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nassigned the name CAN-2005-1852 to this issue.\nIn order to be affected by this issue, a user would need to have registered\nwith Gadu-Gadu and be signed in to the Gadu-Gadu server in order to receive\na malicious message.  In addition, Red Hat believes that the Exec-shield\ntechnology (enabled by default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4) would block\nattempts to remotely exploit this vulnerability.\nNote that this issue does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 or 3.\nUsers of Kopete should update to these packages which contain a\npatch to correct this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
