It is possible for a local\nuser with permissions to execute /sbin/service via sudo to execute\narbitrary commands as the 'root' user. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project assigned the name CVE-2005-3629 to this issue.\nThe following issues have also been fixed in this update:\n* extraneous characters were logged on bootup.\n* fsck would be attempted on filesystems marked with _netdev in rc.sysinit\nbefore they were available.\nAdditionally, support for multi-core Itanium processors has been added to\nredhat-support-check.\nAll users of initscripts should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
