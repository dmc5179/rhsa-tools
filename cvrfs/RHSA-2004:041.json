A local user could exploit this vulnerability to gain\n\"slocate\" group privileges and then read the entire slocate database.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2003-0848 to this issue.\nUsers of Slocate should upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain\nSlocate version 2.7 with the addition of a patch from Kevin Lindsay that\ncauses slocate to drop privileges before reading a user-supplied database.\nFor Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 these packages also fix a buffer overflow\nthat affected unpatched versions of Slocate prior to 2.7.  This\nvulnerability could also allow a local user to gain \"slocate\" group\nprivileges.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0056 to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
