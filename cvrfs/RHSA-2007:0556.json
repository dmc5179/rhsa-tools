A local attacker with the ability to run\nscripts on the Apache HTTP Server could manipulate the scoreboard and cause\narbitrary processes to be terminated which could lead to a denial of\nservice (CVE-2007-3304).  This issue is not exploitable on Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 5 if using the default SELinux targeted policy.\nA flaw was found in the Apache HTTP Server mod_status module. On sites\nwhere the server-status page is publicly accessible and ExtendedStatus is\nenabled this could lead to a cross-site scripting attack. On Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux the server-status page is not enabled by default and it is\nbest practice to not make this publicly available. (CVE-2006-5752)\nA bug was found in the Apache HTTP Server mod_cache module. On sites where\ncaching is enabled, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted\nrequest that would cause the Apache child process handling that request to\ncrash. This could lead to a denial of service if using a threaded\nMulti-Processing Module. (CVE-2007-1863)\nUsers of httpd should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues. Users should restart Apache\nafter installing this update.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
