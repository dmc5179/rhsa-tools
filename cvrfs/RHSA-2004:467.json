Given enough of these packets,\nit is possible to exhaust the available memory on the server.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0807 to this issue.\nAdditionally the Samba team has also discovered a denial of service bug in\nthe nmbd daemon.  It is possible that an attacker could send a specially\ncrafted UDP packet which could allow the attacker to anonymously\ncrash nmbd.  This issue only affects nmbd daemons which are configured to\nprocess domain logons.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0808 to this issue.\nUsers of Samba should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain an\nupgrade to Samba-3.0.7, which is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
