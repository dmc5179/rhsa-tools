If a signal interrupted a lock\nrequest, the local POSIX lock was incorrectly created. This could cause a\ndenial of service on the NFS server if a file descriptor was closed before\nits corresponding lock request returned. (CVE-2008-4307, Important)\n* a deficiency was found in the Linux kernel system call auditing\nimplementation on 64-bit systems. This could allow a local, unprivileged\nuser to circumvent a system call audit configuration, if that configuration\nfiltered based on the \"syscall\" number or arguments.\n(CVE-2009-0834, Important)\n* the exit_notify() function in the Linux kernel did not properly reset the\nexit signal if a process executed a set user ID (setuid) application before\nexiting. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to elevate their\nprivileges. (CVE-2009-1337, Important)\n* a flaw was found in the ecryptfs_write_metadata_to_contents() function of\nthe Linux kernel eCryptfs implementation. On systems with a 4096 byte\npage-size, this flaw may have caused 4096 bytes of uninitialized kernel\nmemory to be written into the eCryptfs file headers, leading to an\ninformation leak. Note: Encrypted files created on systems running the\nvulnerable version of eCryptfs may contain leaked data in the eCryptfs file\nheaders. This update does not remove any leaked data. Refer to the\nKnowledgebase article in the References section for further information.\n(CVE-2009-0787, Moderate)\n* the Linux kernel implementation of the Network File System (NFS) did not\nproperly initialize the file name limit in the nfs_server data structure.\nThis flaw could possibly lead to a denial of service on a client mounting\nan NFS share. (CVE-2009-1336, Moderate)\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n* the enic driver (Cisco 10G Ethernet) did not operate under\nvirtualization. (BZ#472474)\n* network interfaces using the IBM eHEA Ethernet device driver could not be\nsuccessfully configured under low-memory conditions. (BZ#487035)\n* bonding with the \"arp_validate=3\" option may have prevented fail overs.\n(BZ#488064)\n* when running under virtualization, the acpi-cpufreq module wrote \"Domain\nattempted WRMSR\" errors to the dmesg log. (BZ#488928)\n* NFS clients may have experienced deadlocks during unmount. (BZ#488929)\n* the ixgbe driver double counted the number of received bytes and packets.\n(BZ#489459)\n* the Wacom Intuos3 Lens Cursor device did not work correctly with the\nWacom Intuos3 12x12 tablet. (BZ#489460)\n* on the ItaniumÂ® architecture, nanosleep() caused commands which used it,\nsuch as sleep and usleep, to sleep for one second more than expected.\n(BZ#490434)\n* a panic and corruption of slab cache data structures occurred on 64-bit\nPowerPC systems when clvmd was running. (BZ#491677)\n* the NONSTOP_TSC feature did not perform correctly on the IntelÂ®\nmicroarchitecture (Nehalem) when running in 32-bit mode. (BZ#493356)\n* keyboards may not have functioned on IBM eServer System p machines after\na certain point during installation or afterward. (BZ#494293)\n* using Device Mapper Multipathing with the qla2xxx driver resulted in\nfrequent path failures. (BZ#495635)\n* if the hypervisor was booted with the dom0_max_vcpus parameter set to\nless than the actual number of CPUs in the system, and the cpuspeed service\nwas started, the hypervisor could crash. (BZ#495931)\n* using Openswan to provide an IPsec virtual private network eventually\nresulted in a CPU soft lockup and a system crash. (BZ#496044)\n* it was possible for posix_locks_deadlock() to enter an infinite loop\n(under the BKL), causing a system hang. (BZ#496842)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
