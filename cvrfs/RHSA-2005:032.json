PHP applications may use the unserialize function on untrusted user\ndata, which could allow a remote attacker to gain access to memory or\npotentially execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1019 to\nthis issue.\nA flaw in the exif extension of PHP was found which lead to a stack\noverflow. An attacker could create a carefully crafted image file in such\na way which, if parsed by a PHP script using the exif extension, could\ncause a crash or potentially execute arbitrary code. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-1065 to this issue.\nFlaws were found in shmop_write, pack, and unpack PHP functions. These\nfunctions are not normally passed user supplied data, so would require a\nmalicious PHP script to be exploited. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1018 to\nthis issue.\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain fixes\nfor these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
