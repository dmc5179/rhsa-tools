On sites where mod_imap was\nenabled and an imagemap file was publicly available, a cross-site scripting\nattack was possible. (CVE-2007-5000)\nA flaw was found in the mod_autoindex module. On sites where directory\nlistings are used, and the \"AddDefaultCharset\" directive has been removed\nfrom the configuration, a cross-site scripting attack was possible against\nWeb browsers which did not correctly derive the response character set\nfollowing the rules in RFC 2616. (CVE-2007-4465)\nA flaw was found in the mod_proxy module. On sites where a reverse proxy is\nconfigured, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request that\nwould cause the Apache child process handling that request to crash. On\nsites where a forward proxy is configured, an attacker could cause a\nsimilar crash if a user could be persuaded to visit a malicious site using\nthe proxy. This could lead to a denial of service if using a threaded\nMulti-Processing Module. (CVE-2007-3847) \nA flaw was found in the mod_status module. On sites where mod_status was\nenabled and the status pages were publicly available, a cross-site\nscripting attack was possible. (CVE-2007-6388)\nA flaw was found in the mod_proxy_ftp module. On sites where mod_proxy_ftp\nwas enabled and a forward proxy was configured, a cross-site scripting\nattack was possible against Web browsers which did not correctly derive the\nresponse character set following the rules in RFC 2616. (CVE-2008-0005)\nUsers of Apache httpd should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve these issues. Users should restart\nhttpd after installing this update.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
