It provides the basic low-level functionality that\nfull-fledged graphical user interfaces are designed upon.\nAn input validation flaw was discovered in X.org's Security and Record\nextensions. A malicious authorized client could exploit this issue to cause\na denial of service (crash) or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with\nroot privileges on the X.Org server. (CVE-2008-1377)\nMultiple integer overflow flaws were found in X.org's Render extension. A\nmalicious authorized client could exploit these issues to cause a denial of\nservice (crash) or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with root\nprivileges on the X.Org server. (CVE-2008-2360, CVE-2008-2361)\nAn input validation flaw was discovered in X.org's MIT-SHM extension. A\nclient connected to the X.org server could read arbitrary server memory.\nThis could result in the sensitive data of other users of the X.org server\nbeing disclosed. (CVE-2008-1379)\nUsers of xorg-x11 should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
