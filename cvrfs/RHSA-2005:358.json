A local user could create a\nmaliciously crafted regular expression in such as way that they could gain\nthe privileges of the 'exim' user.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project assigned the name CAN-2005-2491 to this issue.  These\nerratum packages change Exim to use the system PCRE library instead of the\ninternal one.  \nThese packages also fix a minor flaw where the Exim Monitor was incorrectly\ncomputing free space on very large file systems.\nUsers should upgrade to these erratum packages and also ensure they have\nupdated the system PCRE library, for which erratum packages are available\nseperately in RHSA-2005:761","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
