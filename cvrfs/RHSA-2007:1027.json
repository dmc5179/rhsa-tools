An\nattacker could create a malicious PDF file that would cause TeTeX to crash\nor potentially execute arbitrary code when opened. \n(CVE-2007-4352, CVE-2007-5392, CVE-2007-5393)\nA flaw was found in the t1lib library, used in the handling of Type 1\nfonts. An attacker could create a malicious file that would cause TeTeX to\ncrash, or potentially execute arbitrary code when opened.
