(CVE-2007-2172,\nImportant)\n* a flaw was found in the handling of process death signals. This allowed a\nlocal, unprivileged user to send arbitrary signals to the suid-process\nexecuted by that user. Successful exploitation of this flaw depended on the\nstructure of the suid-program and its signal handling. (CVE-2007-3848,\nImportant)\n* when accessing kernel memory locations, certain Linux kernel drivers\nregistering a fault handler did not perform required range checks. A local,\nunprivileged user could use this flaw to gain read or write access to\narbitrary kernel memory, or possibly cause a kernel crash. (CVE-2008-0007,\nImportant)\n* a possible kernel memory leak was found in the Linux kernel Simple\nInternet Transition (SIT) INET6 implementation. This could allow a local,\nunprivileged user to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2008-2136, Important)\n* missing capability checks were found in the SBNI WAN driver which could\nallow a local, unprivileged user to bypass intended capability\nrestrictions. (CVE-2008-3525, Important)\n* a flaw was found in the way files were written using truncate() or\nftruncate(). This could allow a local, unprivileged user to acquire the\nprivileges of a different group and obtain access to sensitive information.\n(CVE-2008-4210, Important)\n* a flaw was found in the ELF handling on Itanium-based systems. This\ntriggered a cross-region memory-mapping and allowed a local, unprivileged\nuser to cause a local denial of service. (CVE-2006-4538, Moderate)\n* a race condition in the mincore system core allowed a local, unprivileged\nuser to cause a local denial of service (system hang). (CVE-2006-4814,\nModerate)\n* a flaw was found in the aacraid SCSI driver. This allowed a local,\nunprivileged user to make ioctl calls to the driver which should otherwise\nbe restricted to privileged users. (CVE-2007-4308, Moderate)\n* two buffer overflow flaws were found in the Integrated Services Digital\nNetwork (ISDN) subsystem. A local, unprivileged user could use these flaws\nto cause a denial of service. (CVE-2007-6063, CVE-2007-6151, Moderate)\n* a flaw was found in the way core dump files were created. If a local,\nunprivileged user could make a root-owned process dump a core file into a\nuser-writable directory, the user could gain read access to that core file,\npotentially compromising sensitive information. (CVE-2007-6206, Moderate)\n* a deficiency was found in the Linux kernel virtual file system (VFS)\nimplementation. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to attempt file\ncreation within deleted directories, possibly causing a local denial of\nservice. (CVE-2008-3275, Moderate)\nAll users of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 on 64-bit architectures should\nupgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported patches to\nresolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
