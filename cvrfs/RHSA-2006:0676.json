A malicious web page could crash the browser or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code as the user running SeaMonkey.  (CVE-2006-4565,\nCVE-2006-4566)\nA flaw was found in the handling of Javascript timed events. A malicious\nweb page could crash the browser or possibly execute arbitrary code as the\nuser running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2006-4253)\nDaniel Bleichenbacher recently described an implementation error in RSA\nsignature verification.  For RSA keys with exponent 3 it is possible for an\nattacker to forge a signature that would be incorrectly verified by the NSS\nlibrary. SeaMonkey as shipped trusts several root Certificate Authorities\nthat use exponent 3.  An attacker could have created a carefully crafted\nSSL certificate which be incorrectly trusted when their site was visited by\na victim. (CVE-2006-4340)\nSeaMonkey did not properly prevent a frame in one domain from injecting\ncontent into a sub-frame that belongs to another domain, which facilitates\nwebsite spoofing and other attacks (CVE-2006-4568)\nA flaw was found in SeaMonkey Messenger triggered when a HTML message\ncontained a remote image pointing to a XBL script.  An attacker could have\ncreated a carefully crafted message which would execute Javascript if\ncertain actions were performed on the email by the recipient, even if\nJavascript was disabled. (CVE-2006-4570)\nA number of flaws were found in SeaMonkey.  A malicious web page could\ncrash the browser or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running\nSeaMonkey.  (CVE-2006-4571)\nUsers of SeaMonkey or Mozilla are advised to upgrade to this update, which\ncontains SeaMonkey version 1.0.5 that corrects these issues.\nFor users of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 this SeaMonkey update obsoletes\nGaleon.
