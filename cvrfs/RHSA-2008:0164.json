An unauthenticated remote attacker\ncould use this flaw to crash kadmind or possibly execute arbitrary code.\nThis issue only affected systems with certain resource limits configured\nand did not affect systems using default resource limits used by Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 5. (CVE-2008-0947)\nRed Hat would like to thank MIT for reporting these issues.\nMultiple memory management flaws were discovered in the GSSAPI library used\nby MIT Kerberos. These flaws could possibly result in use of already freed\nmemory or an attempt to free already freed memory blocks (double-free\nflaw), possibly causing a crash or arbitrary code execution.\n(CVE-2007-5901, CVE-2007-5971)\nIn addition to the security issues resolved above, the following bugs were\nalso fixed:\n* delegated krb5 credentials were not properly stored when SPNEGO was the\nunderlying mechanism during GSSAPI authentication. Consequently,\napplications attempting to copy delegated Kerberos 5 credentials into a\ncredential cache received an \"Invalid credential was supplied\" message\nrather than a copy of the delegated credentials. With this update, SPNEGO\ncredentials can be properly searched, allowing applications to copy\ndelegated credentials as expected.\n* applications can initiate context acceptance (via gss_accept_sec_context)\nwithout passing a ret_flags value that would indicate that credentials were\ndelegated. A delegated credential handle should have been returned in such\ninstances. This updated package adds a temp_ret_flag that stores the\ncredential status in the event no other ret_flags value is passed by an\napplication calling gss_accept_sec_context.\n* kpasswd did not fallback to TCP on receipt of certain errors, or when a\npacket was too big for UDP. This update corrects this.\n* when the libkrb5 password-routine generated a set-password or\nchange-password request, incorrect sequence numbers were generated for all\nrequests subsequent to the first request. This caused password change\nrequests to fail if the primary server was unavailable. This updated\npackage corrects this by saving the sequence number value after the AP-REQ\ndata is built and restoring this value before the request is generated.\n* when a user's password expired, kinit would not prompt that user to\nchange the password, instead simply informing the user their password had\nexpired. This update corrects this behavior: kinit now prompts for a new\npassword to be set when a password has expired.\nAll krb5 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported fixes to address these vulnerabilities and fix these\nbugs.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
