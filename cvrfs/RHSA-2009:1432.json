A web\npage containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,\npotentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\nSeaMonkey. (CVE-2009-3072, CVE-2009-3075)\nA use-after-free flaw was found in SeaMonkey. An attacker could use this\nflaw to crash SeaMonkey or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2009-3077)\nDan Kaminsky discovered flaws in the way browsers such as SeaMonkey handle\nNULL characters in a certificate. If an attacker is able to get a\ncarefully-crafted certificate signed by a Certificate Authority trusted by\nSeaMonkey, the attacker could use the certificate during a\nman-in-the-middle attack and potentially confuse SeaMonkey into accepting\nit by mistake. (CVE-2009-2408)\nDescriptions in the dialogs when adding and removing PKCS #11 modules were\nnot informative. An attacker able to trick a user into installing a\nmalicious PKCS #11 module could use this flaw to install their own\nCertificate Authority certificates on a user's machine, making it possible\nto trick the user into believing they are viewing a trusted site or,\npotentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\nSeaMonkey. (CVE-2009-3076)\nA flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey displays the address bar when\nwindow.open() is called in a certain way. An attacker could use this flaw\nto conceal a malicious URL, possibly tricking a user into believing they\nare viewing a trusted site. (CVE-2009-2654)\nDan Kaminsky found that browsers still accept certificates with MD2 hash\nsignatures, even though MD2 is no longer considered a cryptographically\nstrong algorithm. This could make it easier for an attacker to create a\nmalicious certificate that would be treated as trusted by a browser. NSS\n(provided by SeaMonkey) now disables the use of MD2 and MD4 algorithms\ninside signatures by default. (CVE-2009-2409)\nAll SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct\nthese issues. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for\nthe changes to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
