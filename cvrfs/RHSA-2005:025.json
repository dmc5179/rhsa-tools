If SPA authentication is\nenabled, a remote attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability to\nexecute arbitrary code as the 'exim' user.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0022 to\nthis issue.  Please note that SPA authentication is not enabled by default\nin Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.\nBuffer overflow flaws were discovered in the host_aton and\ndns_build_reverse functions in Exim.  A local user can trigger these flaws\nby executing exim with carefully crafted command line arguments and may be\nable to gain the privileges of the 'exim' account.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2005-0021 to this issue.\nUsers of Exim are advised to update to these erratum packages which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
