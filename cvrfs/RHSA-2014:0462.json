A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,\nwhich gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in\nthe References section.","Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit combines popular open source web frameworks\ninto a single solution for Java applications. The JBoss Seam Remoting\ncomponent provides a convenient method for remotely accessing Seam\ncomponents from a web page, using AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML).\nIt was found that JBoss Seam response envelopes included unsanitized\nparameter and ID names provided in the request. This allowed a request to\ninject arbitrary XML into the response. A remote attacker could use this\nflaw to perform reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, provided the\nJBoss Seam remoting application did not use any cross-site request forgery\n(CSRF) protection. (CVE-2014-0149)\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.5.0 as provided from the Red\nHat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
