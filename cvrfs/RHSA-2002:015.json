Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains\nthe desired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2002:015"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["This updated at package fixes two minor problems and one major\nproblem where the environment can get wiped out prior to the execution of a\nscheduled command.\nFor versions of Red Hat Linux prior to 7.2, this package also fixes a\npotential security vulnerability which can result in heap corruption (Red\nHat Linux 7.2 is not vulnerable to this security exploit).\nUpdate 2002-02-01: The package for Red Hat Linux 6.2 tried to source a file\nin /etc/init.d, which doesn't exist on a standard system.","A server running the latest version of at could have commands \nthat depend on the current environment (for example, the PATH) which would\nthen fail or run incorrectly because the environment would not be\naccessible when the command was executed at a later time.\nAdditionally, in versions of Red Hat Linux prior to 7.2 a malicious local\nuser could specify an execution time is in a carefully drafted format\ncausing a heap corruption bug.  Since the at command is installed as setuid\nroot this bug can be exploited.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities  and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0004 to this issue.  Thanks to zen-parse for\nreporting this vulnerability.\nIn addition to the fixed heap corruption, file handling security on all\nversions of at has been improved by adding the O_EXCL (exclusive) option to\nan open system call.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
