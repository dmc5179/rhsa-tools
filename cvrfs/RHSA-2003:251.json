The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0468 to\nthis issue.\nPostfix versions from 1.1 up to and including 1.1.12 have a bug where a\nremote attacker could send a malformed envelope address and:\n1) cause the queue manager to lock up until an entry is removed from the\nqueue or,\n2) lock up the SMTP listener, leading to a DoS.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2003-0540 to this issue.\nUsers of Postfix are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain a version of Postfix 1.1.12 with the addition of a security patch\nand is not vulnerable to either of these issues.\nRed Hat would like to thank Michal Zalewski for discovering and disclosing\nthe flaws and to Wietse Venema for providing patches.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
