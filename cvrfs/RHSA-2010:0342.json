A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\nbase score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the\nCVE link in the References section.","The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\nThis update fixes the following security issue:\n* a flaw was found in the sctp_rcv_ootb() function in the Linux kernel\nStream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation. A remote\nattacker could send a specially-crafted SCTP packet to a target system,\nresulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2010-0008, Important)\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n* the fix for CVE-2009-4538 provided by RHSA-2010:0111 introduced a\nregression, preventing Wake on LAN (WoL) working for network devices using\nthe Intel PRO/1000 Linux driver, e1000e. Attempting to configure WoL for\nsuch devices resulted in the following error, even when configuring valid\noptions:\n\"Cannot set new wake-on-lan settings: Operation not supported not\nsetting wol\"\nThis update resolves this regression, and WoL now works as expected for\nnetwork devices using the e1000e driver. (BZ#565495)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
