These packages prevent possible denial of service attacks and\nsecurity breaches as discovered by the Oulu University Secure Programming Group","The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) enables\nmonitoring and configuration of network nodes.\nThe Oulu University Secure Programming Group performed\na vulnerability assessment of various SNMP implementations through syntax\ntesting and test-suite creation.\nThe test-suite showed several failures in the ucd-snmp tools in version\n4.2.2 and earlier. These vulnerabilities can cause denial-of-service\nconditions, service interruptions, and in some cases could result in a\nremote security breach.\nUpdated ucd-snmp packages are provided that are not susceptible to these\nvulnerabilities and which pass all tests of the test-suite sucessfully.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the names CAN-2002-0012 and CAN-2002-0013 to these issues.\nAll users of ucd-snmp should upgrade to these errata packages.\nFor Red Hat Linux 7.2 updated packages for ethereal (a network traffic\nanalyser that makes use of ucd-snmp) are directly available\nvia this errata as well. For all previous versions of Red Hat Linux a\nseparate powertools errata will provide updated ethereal packages.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
