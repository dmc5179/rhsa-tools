A\nlocal user could send a specially-crafted IOCTL request that would cause a\ndenial of service or, possibly, privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3080,\nImportant)\n* a flaw was found in the collect_rx_frame() function in the HiSax ISDN\ndriver (hfc_usb) in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this flaw to\nsend a specially-crafted HDLC packet that could trigger a buffer out of\nbounds, possibly resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2009-4005,\nImportant)\n* permission issues were found in the megaraid_sas driver (for SAS based\nRAID controllers) in the Linux kernel. The \"dbg_lvl\" and \"poll_mode_io\"\nfiles on the sysfs file system (\"/sys/\") had world-writable permissions.\nThis could allow local, unprivileged users to change the behavior of the\ndriver. (CVE-2009-3889, CVE-2009-3939, Moderate)\n* a buffer overflow flaw was found in the hfs_bnode_read() function in the\nHFS file system implementation in the Linux kernel. This could lead to a\ndenial of service if a user browsed a specially-crafted HFS file system,\nfor example, by running \"ls\". (CVE-2009-4020, Low)\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n* if a process was using ptrace() to trace a multi-threaded process, and\nthat multi-threaded process dumped its core, the process performing the\ntrace could hang in wait4(). This issue could be triggered by running\n\"strace -f\" on a multi-threaded process that was dumping its core,\nresulting in the strace command hanging. (BZ#555869)\n* a bug in the ptrace() implementation could have, in some cases, caused\nptrace_detach() to create a zombie process if the process being traced\nwas terminated with a SIGKILL signal. (BZ#555869)\n* the RHSA-2010:0020 update resolved an issue (CVE-2009-4537) in the\nRealtek r8169 Ethernet driver. This update implements a better solution for\nthat issue. Note: This is not a security regression. The original fix was\ncomplete. This update is adding the official upstream fix. (BZ#556406)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
