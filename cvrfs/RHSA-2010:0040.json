A specially-crafted image file could cause the PHP interpreter\nto crash or, possibly, disclose portions of its memory when a PHP script\ntried to extract Exchangeable image file format (Exif) metadata from the\nimage file. (CVE-2009-2687, CVE-2009-3292)\nA missing input sanitization flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was\ndiscovered in PHP's gd library. A specially-crafted GD image file could\ncause the PHP interpreter to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code\nwhen opened. (CVE-2009-3546)\nIt was discovered that PHP did not limit the maximum number of files that\ncan be uploaded in one request. A remote attacker could use this flaw to\ninstigate a denial of service by causing the PHP interpreter to use lots of\nsystem resources dealing with requests containing large amounts of files to\nbe uploaded. This vulnerability depends on file uploads being enabled\n(which it is, in the default PHP configuration). (CVE-2009-4017)\nNote: This update introduces a new configuration option, max_file_uploads,\nused for limiting the number of files that can be uploaded in one request.\nBy default, the limit is 20 files per request.\nIt was discovered that PHP was affected by the previously published \"null\nprefix attack\", caused by incorrect handling of NUL characters in X.509\ncertificates. If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted certificate\nsigned by a trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker could use the\ncertificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially confuse PHP\ninto accepting it by mistake. (CVE-2009-3291)\nIt was discovered that PHP's htmlspecialchars() function did not properly\nrecognize partial multi-byte sequences for some multi-byte encodings,\nsending them to output without them being escaped. An attacker could use\nthis flaw to perform a cross-site scripting attack. (CVE-2009-4142)\nAll php users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the updated\npackages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
