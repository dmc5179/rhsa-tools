Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains\nthe\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2002:027"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["[Update 20 Mar 2002:\nVNC packages updated to fix another denial of service vulnerability caused\nby the previous update. Thanks to Const Kaplinsky for discovering this\nissue.]\nThe zlib compression library provides in-memory compression and  \ndecompression functions. It is widely used throughout Linux  \nand other operating systems.  \nWhile performing tests on the gdk-pixbuf library, Matthias Clasen created  \nan invalid PNG image that caused libpng to crash.  Upon further  \ninvestigation, this turned out to be a bug in zlib 1.1.3. Certain  \ninput will cause zlib to free an area of memory twice (also called a  \n\"double free\").  \nThis bug can be used to crash any program that takes untrusted compressed  \ninput. Web browsers or email programs that display image attachments or  \nother programs that uncompress data are particularly affected. This  \nvulnerability makes it easy to perform various denial-of-service attacks  \nagainst such programs.   \nHowever, since the result of a double free is the corruption of the  \nmalloc implementation's data structures, it is possible that an attacker\ncould manage a more significant exploit, such as running arbitrary code on\nthe affected system.","Most of the packages in Red Hat Linux use the shared zlib library and can\nbe protected against vulnerability by updating to the errata zlib\npackage.  However, there have been a number of packages identified in Red\nHat Linux that either statically link to zlib or contain an internal\nversion of zlib code.\nAlthough no exploits for this issue or the affected packages are currently\nknown to exist, this is a serious vulnerability that could be locally or\nremotely  exploited. All users should upgrade affected packages\nimmediately.\nAdditionally, if you have any programs that you have compiled yourself\nyou should check to see if they use zlib. If they link to the shared\nzlib library then they will not be vulnerable once the shared zlib\nlibrary is updated to the errata package. If any programs that decompress\narbitrary data either statically link to zlib or use their own version of\nthe zlib code internally, then they need to be patched or recompiled.\nThe following details apply to the Powertools distribution only;\nfor packages included with the main Red Hat Linux distribution\nplease see advisory RHSA-2002:026\nabiword: Powertools 6.2 shipped with both statically and\ndynamically linked versions of AbiWord. The statically linked version\nis linked against the vulnerable zlib. It is recommended that users\nonly use the dynamic version.\nacroread: The acroread package in Powertools 7.0 contains Acrobat\nReader, a PDF viewer. This package contains an internal version of\nzlib which may be vulnerable. An update is not yet available, so users are\nadvised to view PDF documents using xpdf or ghostview.\namaya: Amaya is a Web browser/authoring tool. Amaya in Powertools 7.1\nhas been patched to use the system zlib, libjpeg, and libpng libraries\ninstead of the internal static versions.\nflash: The flash package in Powertools 6.2 and 7.0 contains an\nunofficial Shockwave(TM) Flash2/Flash3 plug-in for Netscape which uses\nan internal version of zlib. This plug-in conflicts with the official\nflash plug-in included in the netscape package and should not be used.\nfreeamp: Freeamp is an MP3 audio player in Powertools 6.2 and 7.0 which\nuses zlib when decompressing themes. Freeamp has been patched\nto use the system zlib library instead of the internal version.\nqt-embedded: Qt is a GUI toolkit for embedded devices.  qt-embedded has\nbeen updated to version 2.3.2 and recompiled against the errata zlib\nlibrary.\nvnc: VNC is a remote display system in Powertools 6.2. VNC has been\npatched to use the system zlib library.  \nIn addition, there is a small HTTP server implementation in the VNC server\nwhich can be made to wait indefinitely for input, thereby freezing an\nactive VNC session.  The VNC packages recommended by this advisory have\nbeen patched to fix this issue, as well. Users of VNC should be aware  the\nprogram is designed for use on a trusted network.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
