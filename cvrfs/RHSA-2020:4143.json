security issues and other bugs are now available for Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage with 3.11.z Async update.\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.","Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage(OCS) is a provider of agnostic persistent storage for OpenShift Container Platform either in-house or in a hybrid cloud. As a Red Hat storage solution, OCS is completely integrated with OpenShift Container Platform for deployment, management, and monitoring.\nSecurity Fix(es):\n* gluster-block: information disclosure through world-readable gluster-block log files (CVE-2020-10762)\n* heketi: gluster-block volume password details available in logs (CVE-2020-10763)\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\nBug Fix(es):\n* Earlier, the tcmu-runner did not give details about the file operations stuck at the backend glusterfs block hosting volume. With this change, the tcmu-runner is now able to log details about the file operations stuck at the backend glusterfs block hosting volume and this will help identify the root cause of the input/output errors easily. (BZ#1850361)\n* Earlier, there was no log rotation with gluster-block logs. With this release, log rotation is possible for gluster-block and tcmu-runner relevant logs. (BZ#1850365)\n* Earlier, heketi did not track all the changes made to volumes as part of device remove operation. With this release, heketi’s device remove operation is fully tracked and is based on a series of brick evict operations making the operation more reliable. (BZ#1850072)\n* An access flaw CVE-2020-13867 was found in targetcli due to which the files under ‘/etc/target’ and '/etc/target/backup' directory were widely accessible. With this release, the access flaw is fixed as a workaround in gluster-block to protect these files from any potential attacks for accessing sensitive information, until the flaw is resolved and made available in targetcli.(BZ#1850077)\nAll Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
