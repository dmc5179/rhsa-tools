This bug could allow an authenticated remote\nattacker to execute arbitrary commands on a realm's master Kerberos KDC. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-1189 to this issue.\nAdditionally a temporary file bug was found in the Kerberos krb5-send-pr\nprogram.  It is possible that an attacker could create a temporary file\nthat would allow an arbitrary file to be overwritten which the victim has\nwrite access to.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0971 to this issue.\nAll users of krb5 should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported security patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
