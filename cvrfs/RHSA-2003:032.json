This causes tcpdump to generate data within an\ninfinite loop.\nA vulnerability in tcpdump before 3.7.2 is related to an inability to\nhandle unknown RADIUS attributes properly, and allows remote attackers to\ncause a denial of service (infinite loop).\nThe ISAKMP parser in tcpdump 3.6 through 3.7.1 allows remote attackers to\ncause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a malformed ISAKMP\npacket to UDP port 500, causing tcpdump to enter an infinite loop.\nUsers of tcpdump are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which\ncontain patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
