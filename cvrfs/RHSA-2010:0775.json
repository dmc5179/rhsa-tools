A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\nbase score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the\nCVE link in the References section.","Cobbler is a network install server. Cobbler supports PXE, virtualized\ninstalls, and re-installing existing Linux machines. Cheetah is a template\nengine used by Cobbler to process kickstart files.\nA code injection flaw was found in the way Cobbler processed templates for\nkickstart files. A remote, authenticated user, that has the Configuration\nAdministrator role privilege, could use this flaw to create a\nspecially-crafted kickstart template file containing embedded Python code\nthat could, when processed by Cheetah, execute arbitrary code with root\nprivileges on the Red Hat Network Satellite Server. (CVE-2010-2235)\nRed Hat would like to thank Doug Knight of the University of Alaska for\nreporting this issue.\nUsers of Red Hat Network Satellite Server 5.3 are advised to upgrade to\nthis updated cobbler package, which contains backported patches to correct\nthis issue. Red Hat Network Satellite Server must be restarted\n(\"/usr/sbin/rhn-satellite restart\") for this update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
