Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of\nup2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be\ndownloaded directly from the RHN website:\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2005:152"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Low","type":"Impact"}},"discovery_date":"2005-01-28T00:00:00Z","ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated postfix packages that include a security fix and two other bug\nfixes are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.\nThis update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat\nSecurity Response Team","Postfix is a Mail Transport Agent (MTA), supporting LDAP, SMTP AUTH (SASL),\nand TLS.\nA flaw was found in the ipv6 patch used with Postfix.
