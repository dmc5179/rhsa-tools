Showmount queries\nthe mount daemon on a remote host for information about the NFS\n(Network File System) server on the remote host.\nSGI reported that the statd daemon did not properly handle the SIGPIPE\nsignal.  A misconfigured or malicious peer could cause statd to crash,\nleading to a denial of service.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1014 to this issue.\nArjan van de Ven discovered a buffer overflow in rquotad.  On 64-bit\narchitectures, an improper integer conversion can lead to a buffer\noverflow.  An attacker with access to an NFS share could send a specially\ncrafted request which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2004-0946 to this issue.\nAdditionally, this updated package addresses the following issues:\n- The UID of the nfsnobody account has been fixed for 32-bit and 64-bit\nmachines. Because the st_uid field of the stat structure is an unsigned\ninteger, an actual value of -2 cannot be used when creating the account, so\nthe decimal value of -2 is used. On a 32-bit machine, the decimal value of\n-2 is 65534 but on a 64-bit machine it is 4294967294. This errata enables\nthe nfs-utils post-install script to detect the target architecture, so an\nappropriate decimal value is used.\nAll users of nfs-utils should upgrade to this updated package, which\nresolves these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
