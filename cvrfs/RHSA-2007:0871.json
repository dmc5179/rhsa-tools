This could allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information,\nsuch as session IDs, for session hijacking attacks (CVE-2007-3382).\nIt was reported Tomcat did not properly handle the following character\nsequence in a cookie: \\\" (a backslash followed by a double-quote). It was\npossible remote attackers could use this failure to obtain sensitive\ninformation, such as session IDs, for session hijacking attacks\n(CVE-2007-3385).\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability existed in the Host Manager\nServlet. This allowed remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTML and web\nscript via crafted requests (CVE-2007-3386).\nUsers of Tomcat should update to these erratum packages, which contain\nbackported patches and are not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
