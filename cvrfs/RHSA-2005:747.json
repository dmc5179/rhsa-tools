Like locate, slocate\nsearches through a nightly-updated central database for files that match a\ngiven pattern.\nA bug was found in the way slocate processes very long paths. A local user\ncould create a carefully crafted directory structure that would prevent\nupdatedb from completing its file system scan, resulting in an incomplete\nslocate database. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has\nassigned the name CAN-2005-2499 to this issue.\nUsers are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which includes a\nbackported patch to resolve this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
