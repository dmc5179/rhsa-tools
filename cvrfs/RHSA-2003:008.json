Versions of\nMgetty prior to 1.1.29 would overflow an internal buffer if the caller name\nreported by the modem was too long.\nAdditionally, the faxspool script supplied with versions of Mgetty prior to\n1.1.29 used a simple permissions scheme to allow or deny fax transmission\nprivileges.  This scheme was easily circumvented because the spooling\ndirectory used for outgoing faxes was world-writable.\nAll users of Mgetty should upgrade to these errata packages, which\ncontain Mgetty 1.1.30 and are not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
