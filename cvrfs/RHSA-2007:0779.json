A remote attacker could spoof messages in\nthe error log, and possibly trick the administrator into visiting malicious\nURLs via a carriage return/line feed sequence in the URI. (CVE-2006-4624)\nAs well, these updated packages fix the following bugs:\n* canceling a subscription on the confirm subscription request page\ncaused mailman to crash.\n* editing the sender filter caused all spam filter rules to be deleted.\n* the migrate-fhs script was not included.\n* the mailman init script returned a zero (success) exit code even when\nan incorrect command was given. For example, the \"mailman foo\" command\nreturned a zero exit code. In these updated packages the mailmain init\nscript returns the correct exit codes.\nUsers of Mailman are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\nresolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
