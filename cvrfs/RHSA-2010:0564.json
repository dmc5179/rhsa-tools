A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\nbase score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the\nCVE link in the References section.\n[Updated 28 July 2010]\nThe CVE-2010-1871 description has been updated to reflect that an attacker\ndoes not need to be authenticated to exploit this issue. No changes have\nbeen made to the packages.","The JBoss Seam Framework is an application framework for building web\napplications in Java.\nAn input sanitization flaw was found in the way JBoss Seam processed\ncertain parametrized JBoss Expression Language (EL) expressions. A remote\nattacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code via a URL,\ncontaining appended, specially-crafted expression language parameters,\nprovided to certain applications based on the JBoss Seam framework. Note: A\nproperly configured and enabled Java Security Manager would prevent\nexploitation of this flaw. (CVE-2010-1871)\nRed Hat would like to thank Meder Kydyraliev of the Google Security Team\nfor responsibly reporting this issue.\nUsers of jboss-seam2 should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to correct this issue. The JBoss server process\nmust be restarted for this update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
