An\nunauthenticated remote attacker could use these flaws to trigger high\nmemory consumption in the Directory Server, possibly causing it to crash or\nterminate unexpectedly when running out of available memory. (CVE-2008-3283)\n[Updated 3rd October 2008]\nUlf Weltman of Hewlett Packard discovered a flaw in the way Directory\nServer handled LDAP search requests with patterns. A remote attacker with\naccess to the LDAP service could create a search request that, when the\nsearch pattern was matched against specially crafted data records, caused\nDirectory Server to use a large amount of CPU time because the Directory \nServer did not impose time limits on such search requests. In this updated \npackage, Directory Server imposes the nsslapd-timelimit attribute on the \npattern-search query run times. This attribute has the default limit of \n3600 seconds; to shorten this limit, use ldapmodify to change the \nnsslapd-timelimit value in the cn=config entry. (CVE-2008-2930)\nIn addition to these security fixes, the following bugs have been fixed in\nthese updated packages:\n* The change sequence numbers in multi-master replication had a built-in\ntime skew to accommodate differences in the clocks on master servers. Under\ncertain circumstances, this skew exceeded the maximum allowable skew,\ncausing replication to stop entirely.\n* If an entry with a large attribute value, such as over 32KB, was\nreplicated, the replication could fail with a DB_BUFFER_SMALL error. \n* If a password policy attribute such as accountunlocktime was added to an\nentry, the server would attempt to replicate that attribute, causing\nreplication to fail. \n*  The Directory Server would crash during the index operation if\nreplication was configured and an attribute value was scheduled to be\ndeleted which was indexed or had an attribute subtype which was indexed.\n* On x86_64 systems, recursively adding groups as members to other groups\ncould crash the server because the stack size for the memberOf plug-in on\n64-bit systems was hard-coded to 256KB, regardless of the ulimit value.\n* Attempting to register a new Directory Server instance to a remote\nConfiguration Directory would fail; a new -u option has been added to the\nsetup-ds-admin.pl script to resolve this.\n* Creating a new Directory Server instance through the Console would fail\nif it was attempted after the Admin Server was restarted.\n* If the Directory Server Console was set to use SSL, then clicking the\n\"Manage Certificates\" in the Console threw a Java exception and the window\nwould not open.\n* A problem in the SASL IO handling meant that memory was not reallocated\nafter SASL binds. For example, a simple bind coming immediately after a\nSASL bind might have failed.\nAll users of Red Hat Directory Server 8.0 should upgrade to these updated\npackages, which resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
