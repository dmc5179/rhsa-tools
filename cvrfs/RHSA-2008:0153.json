A remote attacker could send malicious UDP IPP\npackets causing the CUPS daemon to attempt to dereference already freed\nmemory and crash. (CVE-2008-0597)\nA memory management flaw was found in the way CUPS handled the addition and\nremoval of remote shared printers via IPP.  When shared printer was\nremoved, allocated memory was not properly freed, leading to a memory leak\npossibly causing CUPS daemon crash after exhausting available memory.\n(CVE-2008-0596)\nThese issues were found during the investigation of CVE-2008-0882, which\ndid not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3. \nNote that the default configuration of CUPS on Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n3 allow requests of this type only from the local subnet.\nIn addition, these updated cups packages fix a bug that occurred when using\nthe CUPS polling daemon. Excessive debugging log information was saved to\nthe error_log file regardless of the LogLevel setting, which filled up disk\nspace rapidly.\nAll CUPS users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
