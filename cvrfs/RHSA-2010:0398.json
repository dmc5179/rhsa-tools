Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.","The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n* a flaw was found in the Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE)\nimplementation. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted ISO\nMPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS) frame to a target system, resulting in an\ninfinite loop (denial of service). (CVE-2010-1086, Important)\n* on AMD64 systems, it was discovered that the kernel did not ensure the\nELF interpreter was available before making a call to the SET_PERSONALITY\nmacro. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service by\nrunning a 32-bit application that attempts to execute a 64-bit application.\n(CVE-2010-0307, Moderate)\n* a flaw was found in the kernel connector implementation. A local,\nunprivileged user could trigger this flaw by sending an arbitrary number\nof notification requests using specially-crafted netlink messages,\nresulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2010-0410, Moderate)\n* a flaw was found in the Memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) instruction decoder in\nthe Xen hypervisor implementation. An unprivileged guest user could use\nthis flaw to trick the hypervisor into emulating a certain instruction,\nwhich could crash the guest (denial of service). (CVE-2010-0730, Moderate)\n* a divide-by-zero flaw was found in the azx_position_ok() function in the\ndriver for Intel High Definition Audio, snd-hda-intel. A local,\nunprivileged user could trigger this flaw to cause a kernel crash (denial\nof service). (CVE-2010-1085, Moderate)\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n* in some cases, booting a system with the \"iommu=on\" kernel parameter\nresulted in a Xen hypervisor panic. (BZ#580199)\n* the fnic driver flushed the Rx queue instead of the Tx queue after\nfabric login. This caused crashes in some cases. (BZ#580829)\n* \"kernel unaligned access\" warnings were logged to the dmesg log on some\nsystems. (BZ#580832)\n* the \"Northbridge Error, node 1, core: -1 K8 ECC error\" error occurred on\nsome systems using the amd64_edac driver. (BZ#580836)\n* in rare circumstances, when using kdump and booting a kernel with\n\"crashkernel=128M@16M\", the kdump kernel did not boot after a crash.\n(BZ#580838)\n* TLB page table entry flushing was done incorrectly on IBM System z,\npossibly causing crashes, subtle data inconsistency, or other issues.\n(BZ#580839)\n* iSCSI failover times were slower than in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3.\n(BZ#580840)\n* fixed floating point state corruption after signal. (BZ#580841)\n* in certain circumstances, under heavy load, certain network interface\ncards using the bnx2 driver and configured to use MSI-X, could stop\nprocessing interrupts and then network connectivity would cease.\n(BZ#587799)\n* cnic parts resets could cause a deadlock when the bnx2 device was\nenslaved in a bonding device and that device had an associated VLAN.\n(BZ#581148)\n* some BIOS implementations initialized interrupt remapping hardware in a\nway the Xen hypervisor implementation did not expect. This could have\ncaused a system hang during boot. (BZ#581150)\n* AMD Magny-Cours systems panicked when booting a 32-bit kernel.\n(BZ#580846)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
