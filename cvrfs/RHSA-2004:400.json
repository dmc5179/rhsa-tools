In order\nto exploit these bugs, an attacker would have to perform a man in the\nmiddle attack between the MSN server and the vulnerable Gaim client.  Such\nan attack could allow arbitrary code execution.  The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0500\nto this issue.\nBuffer overflow bugs have been found in the Gaim URL decoder, local\nhostname resolver, and the RTF message parser.  It is possible that a\nremote attacker could send carefully crafted data to a vulnerable client\nand lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0785 to this issue.\nA shell escape bug has been found in the Gaim smiley theme file\ninstallation.  When a user installs a smiley theme, which is contained\nwithin a tar file, the unarchiving of the data is done in an unsafe manner.\nAn attacker could create a malicious smiley theme that would execute\narbitrary commands if the theme was installed by the victim.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0784 to this issue.\nAn integer overflow bug has been found in the Gaim Groupware message\nreceiver.  It is possible that if a user connects to a malicious server,\nan attacker could send carefully crafted data which could lead to arbitrary\ncode execution on the victims machine.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0754 to\nthis issue.\nUsers of Gaim are advised to upgrade to this updated package which\ncontains Gaim version 0.82 and is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
