Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.

The default stylesheet provided\nwith Red Hat Linux has an insecure option enabled.","The default stylesheet used when converting a DocBook document to\nmultiple HTML files allows an untrusted document to write files\noutside of the current directory. This is because element\nidentifiers (specified in the document) are used to form the names of\nthe output files.  If an untrusted document uses a full pathname as an\nidentifier, it can cause that file to be written to -- as long as the\nuser performing the conversion has write access.\nUpdated docbook-utils packages are available that disable this\nfeature and enable filenames to be generated based on the type\nof the element rather than its identifier.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0169 to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
