Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of\nup2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be\ndownloaded directly from the RHN website:\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003:418"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Important","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated kernel packages are now available that fix a security\nvulnerability which may allow local users to gain root privileges.","The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.\nPaul Starzetz discovered a flaw in bounds checking in mremap() in the Linux\nkernel versions 2.4.23 and previous which may allow a local attacker to\ngain root privileges.  No exploit is currently available; however, it is\nbelieved that this issue is exploitable (although not trivially.) The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2003-0985 to this issue.\nAll users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which contain a\nbackported security patch that corrects this issue.  \nRed Hat would like to thank Paul Starzetz from ISEC for disclosing this\nissue as well as Andrea Arcangeli and Solar Designer for working on the patch.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
