A malicious web page could cause the execution of\nJavascript code in such a way that could cause Firefox to crash or execute\narbitrary code as the user running Firefox. (CVE-2006-5463, CVE-2006-5747,\nCVE-2006-5748)\nSeveral flaws were found in the way Firefox renders web pages. A malicious\nweb page could cause the browser to crash or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode as the user running Firefox. (CVE-2006-5464) \nA flaw was found in the way Firefox verifies RSA signatures. For RSA keys\nwith exponent 3 it is possible for an attacker to forge a signature that\nwould be incorrectly verified by the NSS library. Firefox as shipped trusts\nseveral root Certificate Authorities that use exponent 3. An attacker could\nhave created a carefully crafted SSL certificate which be incorrectly\ntrusted when their site was visited by a victim. This flaw was previously\nthought to be fixed in Firefox 1.5.0.7, however Ulrich Kuehn discovered the\nfix was incomplete (CVE-2006-5462)\nUsers of Firefox are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain Firefox version 1.5.0.8 that corrects these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
