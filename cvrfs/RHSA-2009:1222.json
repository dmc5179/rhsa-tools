This\nmacro did not initialize the sendpage operation in the proto_ops structure\ncorrectly. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a local\ndenial of service or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2009-2692, Important)\n* a flaw was found in the udp_sendmsg() implementation in the Linux kernel\nwhen using the MSG_MORE flag on UDP sockets. A local, unprivileged user\ncould use this flaw to cause a local denial of service or escalate their\nprivileges. (CVE-2009-2698, Important)\nRed Hat would like to thank Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes of the Google\nSecurity Team for responsibly reporting these flaws.\nThese updated packages also fix the following bug:\n* in the dlm code, a socket was allocated in tcp_connect_to_sock(), but was\nnot freed in the error exit path. This bug led to a memory leak and an\nunresponsive system. A reported case of this bug occurred after running\n\"cman_tool kill -n [nodename]\". (BZ#515432)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
