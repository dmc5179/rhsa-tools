Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,\nwhich give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability\nfrom the CVE links in the References section.","Red Hat Certificate System is an enterprise software system designed to\nmanage enterprise public key infrastructure (PKI) deployments. Simple\nCertificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) is a PKI communication protocol\nused to automatically enroll certificates for network devices.\nThe certificate authority allowed unauthenticated users to request the\none-time PIN in an SCEP request to be decrypted. An attacker able to sniff\nan SCEP request from a network device could request the certificate\nauthority to decrypt the request, allowing them to obtain the one-time\nPIN. With this update, the certificate authority only handles decryption\nrequests from authenticated registration authorities. (CVE-2010-3868)\nThe certificate authority allowed the one-time PIN used in SCEP requests\nto be re-used. An attacker possessing a valid SCEP enrollment one-time PIN\ncould use it to generate an unlimited number of certificates.\n(CVE-2010-3869)\nThe certificate authority used the MD5 hash algorithm to sign all SCEP\nprotocol responses. As MD5 is not collision resistant, an attacker could\nuse this flaw to perform an MD5 chosen-prefix collision attack to generate\nattack-chosen output signed using the certificate authority's key.\n(CVE-2004-2761)\nThis update also adds the following enhancements:\n* New configuration options for the SCEP server can define the default and\nallowed encryption and hash algorithms. These options allow disabling uses\nof the weaker algorithms not required by network devices and prevent\npossible downgrade attacks. These can be configured by adding the following\noptions to the certificate authority's CS.cfg configuration file:\nca.scep.encryptionAlgorithm=DES3\nca.scep.allowedEncryptionAlgorithms=DES3\nca.scep.hashAlgorithm=SHA1\nca.scep.allowedHashAlgorithms=SHA1,SHA256,SHA512\n* With this update, the certificate authority's SCEP server is disabled by\ndefault. The SCEP server can be enabled by adding the 'ca.scep.enable=true'\noption to the certificate authority's CS.cfg configuration file.\n* A separate key pair can now be configured for use in SCEP communication.\nPreviously, the main certificate authority's key pair was used for SCEP\ncommunication too. A designated SCEP key pair can be referenced by adding\na new option, ca.scep.nickname=[scep certificate nickname], to the\ncertificate authority's CS.cfg configuration file.\n* The certificate authority now allows the size of nonces used in SCEP\nrequests to be restricted by adding a new option, ca.scep.nonceSizeLimit=\n[number of bytes], to the certificate authority's CS.cfg configuration\nfile. The limit is set to 16 bytes in the default CS.cfg configuration\nfile.\nAll users of Red Hat Certificate System 8 should upgrade to these updated\npackages, which resolve these issues and add these enhancements.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
