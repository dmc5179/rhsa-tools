update for redhat-release-virtualization-host and redhat-virtualization-host is now available for Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.","The redhat-virtualization-host packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks.\nSecurity Fix(es):\n* kernel: out-of-bounds write due to a heap buffer overflow in __hidinput_change_resolution_multipliers() of hid-input.c (CVE-2021-0512)\n* Ansible: ansible-connection module discloses sensitive info in traceback error message (CVE-2021-3620)\n* kernel: Insufficient validation of user-supplied sizes for the MSG_CRYPTO message type (CVE-2021-43267)\n* libssh: NULL pointer dereference in sftpserver.c if ssh_buffer_new returns NULL (CVE-2020-16135)\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\nBug Fix(es):\n* Red Hat Virtualization Host now includes packages from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.5. (BZ#1958101)\n* Red Hat Virtualization Host now includes packages from RHGS-3.5.z on RHEL-8 Batch #5. (BZ#1975175)\n* Red Hat Virtualization Host now includes the packages needed for using Managed Block Devices via cinderlib. (BZ#1983021)\n* Red Hat Virtualization Host now includes openvswitch related packages from Fast Data Path 21.G release. (BZ#1998104)\n* Previously it was not possible to upgrade RHVH to version 4.4.8 when custom VDSM hooks were installed on RHVH. This was caused by the VDSM hooks dependency on the concrete version of VDSM. The current release allows users to maintain the VDSM dependency manually. In other words, if you want to upgrade from VDSM X.Y.Z to version A.B.C, you must upgrade all VDSM hooks to the same A.B.C version.
