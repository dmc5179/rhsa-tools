This could allow a local, unprivileged user to elevate their\nprivileges. (CVE-2009-1337, Important)\n* the Linux kernel implementation of the Network File System (NFS) version\n4 did not properly initialize the file name limit in the nfs_server data\nstructure. This flaw could possibly lead to a denial of service on a client\nmounting an NFSv4 share. (CVE-2009-1336, Moderate)\nThis update fixes the following bugs:\n* on IBM System z systems, if the cio driver was used for DASD devices, and\nthe last path to a DASD device was varied off, it was still possible to\nattempt read and write operations to that device, resulting in errors. In\nthis update, path verification is used in this situation, which resolves\nthis issue. Also, a bug may have caused errors when subchannels were\nunregistered. (BZ#437486)\n* a bug prevented the Broadcom NetXtreme II 57710 network device from\nworking correctly on some Dell PowerEdge R805 systems. This device was\ncorrectly shown in \"lspci\" output, but \"ifup\" failed and an IP address was\nnot assigned. In this update, the device works correctly on Dell PowerEdge\nR805 systems. (BZ#491752)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. For this update to take effect, the system\nmust be rebooted.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
