Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,\nwhich give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability\nfrom the CVE links in the References section.","OpenLDAP is an open source suite of LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access\nProtocol) applications and development tools.\nAn uninitialized pointer use flaw was discovered in the way the slapd\ndaemon handled modify relative distinguished name (modrdn) requests. An\nauthenticated user with privileges to perform modrdn operations could use\nthis flaw to crash the slapd daemon via specially-crafted modrdn requests.\n(CVE-2010-0211)\nRed Hat would like to thank CERT-FI for responsibly reporting the\nCVE-2010-0211 flaw, who credit Ilkka Mattila and Tuomas Salomäki for the\ndiscovery of the issue.\nA flaw was found in the way OpenLDAP handled NUL characters in the\nCommonName field of X.509 certificates. An attacker able to get a\ncarefully-crafted certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority\ncould trick applications using OpenLDAP libraries into accepting it by\nmistake, allowing the attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.\n(CVE-2009-3767)\nUsers of OpenLDAP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues. After installing this update,\nthe OpenLDAP daemons will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
