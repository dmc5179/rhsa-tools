A malicious local user could \nmanipulate the file lock in such a way as to prevent dump from running.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned\nthe name CAN-2002-1914 to this issue.\nUsers of dump should upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain a\npatch to resolve this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
