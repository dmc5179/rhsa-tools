Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.","The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\nHypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor\nis a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes\neverything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Agent.\nNote: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for\nthe Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.\nIt was found that the libspice component of QEMU-KVM on the host did not\nvalidate all pointers provided from a guest system's QXL graphics card\ndriver. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to cause the host to\ndereference an invalid pointer, causing the guest to crash (denial of\nservice) or, possibly, resulting in the privileged guest user escalating\ntheir privileges on the host. (CVE-2010-0428)\nIt was found that the libspice component of QEMU-KVM on the host could be\nforced to perform certain memory management operations on memory addresses\ncontrolled by a guest. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash\nthe guest (denial of service) or, possibly, escalate their privileges on\nthe host. (CVE-2010-0429)\nIt was found that QEMU-KVM on the host did not validate all pointers\nprovided from a guest system's QXL graphics card driver. A privileged guest\nuser could use this flaw to cause the host to dereference an invalid\npointer, causing the guest to crash (denial of service) or, possibly,\nresulting in the privileged guest user escalating their privileges on the\nhost. (CVE-2010-0431)\nA flaw was found in QEMU-KVM, allowing the guest some control over the\nindex used to access the callback array during sub-page MMIO\ninitialization. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the\nguest (denial of service) or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the\nhost. (CVE-2010-2784)\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found when Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Hypervisor was run on a system that has a processor with the\nIntel VT-x extension enabled. A privileged guest user could use this flaw\nto trick the host into emulating a certain instruction, which could crash\nthe host (denial of service). (CVE-2010-0435)\nA flaw was found in the way VDSM accepted SSL connections. An attacker\ncould trigger this flaw by creating a crafted SSL connection to VDSM,\npreventing VDSM from accepting SSL connections from other users.\n(CVE-2010-2811)\nThese updated packages provide updated components that include fixes for\nsecurity issues; however, these issues have no security impact for Red Hat\nEnterprise Virtualization Hypervisor. These fixes are for avahi issues\nCVE-2009-0758 and CVE-2010-2244; freetype issues CVE-2010-1797,\nCVE-2010-2498, CVE-2010-2499, CVE-2010-2500, CVE-2010-2519, CVE-2010-2527,\nand CVE-2010-2541; kernel issues CVE-2010-1084, CVE-2010-2066,\nCVE-2010-2070, CVE-2010-2226, CVE-2010-2248, CVE-2010-2521, and\nCVE-2010-2524; and openldap issues CVE-2010-0211 and CVE-2010-0212.\nThese updated rhev-hypervisor packages also fix two bugs. Documentation for\nthese bug fixes will be available shortly from\nhttp://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization_for_Servers/2.2/html/Technical_Notes/index.html\nAs Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug\nfixes from the KVM update RHSA-2010:0627 have been included in this update.\nAlso included are the bug fixes from the VDSM update RHSA-2010:0628.\nKVM: https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0627.html\nVDSM: https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0628.html\nUsers of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to\nupgrade to these updated rhev-hypervisor packages, which resolve these\nissues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
