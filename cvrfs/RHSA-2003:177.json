This is needed so that up2date can continue to\ncommunicate with Red Hat Network once the current CA certificate reaches\nits August 2003 expiration date.\nAll users of Red Hat Network should therefore upgrade to these erratum\npackages.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
