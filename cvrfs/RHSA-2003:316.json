Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of\nup2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be\ndownloaded directly from the RHN website:\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003:316"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Low","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated iproute packages that close a locally-exploitable denial of service\nvulnerability are now available.","The iproute package contains advanced IP routing and network device\nconfiguration tools.\nHerbert Xu reported that iproute can accept spoofed messages sent on the\nkernel netlink interface by other users on the local machine.  This could\nlead to a local denial of service attack.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0856 to\nthis issue. \nUsers of iproute should upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain a\npatch that checks that netlink messages actually came from the kernel.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
