Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.

These\npackages close buffer overflows present in Cyrus SASL 2.1 and later.","Cyrus SASL is an implementation of the Simple Authentication and Security\nLayer, a method for adding authentication support to connection-based\nprotocols.  Cyrus SASL versions 2 prior to 2.1.10 include a number of\nbuffer overflow vulnerabilities:\nInsufficient buffer length checking in user name canonicalization.  This\nissue would be hard to exploit, but would allow a remote user to execute\narbitrary code on the system.\nWhen performing authentication using LDAP, saslauthd does not allocate\nenough memory when it needs to escape special characters in the username\nand realm.  This issue may be easy to remotely exploit.\nThe Log writer might not have allocated memory for the trailing \\0 in a\nmessage. This issue is probably hard to exploit, although it is possible to\naffect the logging data with at least anonymous authentication.\nAll users of Cyrus-SASL on Red Hat Linux 8.0 are advised to upgrade to the\nerratum packages containing Cyrus SASL version 2.1.10 which is not affected\nby these vulnerabilities.  Other Red Hat Linux releases are not affected by\nthis vulnerability as they included Cyrus-SASL version 1.5.x.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
