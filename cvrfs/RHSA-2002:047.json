The size of the array is determined by the\nnumber of messages that the server claims to have. Unpatched versions of\nfetchmail prior to 5.9.10 did not check whether the number of e-mails the\nserver claimed was too high, allowing a malicious server to cause the\nfetchmail process to write data outside of the array bounds.\nUsers of fetchmail are advised to upgrade to this errata package which is\nnot vulnerable to this issue.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0146 to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
