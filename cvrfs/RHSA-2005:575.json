It is\npossible to execute arbitrary code on a victim's machine if the victim is\ntricked into opening a malicious PDF file. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project has assigned the name CAN-2005-1625 to this issue.\nPlease note that there is no browser plugin included with the x86_64 Adobe\nAcrobat Reader package; Therefore the security impact of this issue on\nx86_64 is reduced from \"critical\" to \"important\".\nAdditionally Secunia Research discovered a bug in the way Adobe Acrobat\nReader creates temporary files. When a user opens a document, temporary\nfiles are created which may be world readable, allowing a local user to\nview sensitive information. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject has assigned the name CAN-2005-1841 to this issue.\nAll users of Acrobat Reader are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain Acrobat Reader version 7.0.0 and are not vulnerable\nto this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
