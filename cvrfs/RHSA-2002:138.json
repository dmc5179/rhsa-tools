In addition, unzip\nversion 5.42 and earlier version also allow attackers to overwrite\narbitrary files during archive extraction via filenames in the archive that\nbegin with the \"/\" (slash) character (CAN-2001-1269).\nDuring testing of the fix to GNU tar, we discovered that GNU tar 1.13.25\nwas still vulnerable to a modified version of the same problem. Red Hat has\nprovided a patch to tar 1.3.25 to correct this problem (CAN-2002-0399).\nGNU tar 1.13.19 and other versions before 1.13.25 allow remote attackers\nto overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack, as the result of a\nmodification that effectively disabled the security check.  (CAN-2002-1216)\nUsers of unzip and tar are advised to upgrade to these errata packages,\ncontaining unzip version 5.50 and a patched version of GNU tar 1.13.25,\nwhich are not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
