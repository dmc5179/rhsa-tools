Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate \nErrors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated \ncertificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat \nFTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003:264"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated gtkhtml packages that fix a null pointer dereference are now available.","GtkHTML is the HTML rendering widget used by the Evolution mail reader. \nVersions of GtkHTML prior to 1.1.10 contain a bug when handling HTML\nmessages.  Alan Cox discovered that certain malformed messages could cause\nthe Evolution mail component to crash due to a null pointer dereference in\nthe GtkHTML library.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0541 to this issue.\nUsers of Evolution are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain GtkHTML version 1.1.10 correcting this issue.\nRed Hat would like to thank the Ximian security team for investigating and\nfixing this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
