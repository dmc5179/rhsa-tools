A local unprivileged\nuser could truncate directories to which they had write permission; this\ncould render the contents of the directory inaccessible. (CVE-2008-0001,\nImportant)\nA flaw was found in the implementation of ptrace. A local unprivileged user\ncould trigger this flaw and possibly cause a denial of service (system\nhang). (CVE-2007-5500, Important)\nA flaw was found in the way the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 kernel handled\npage faults when a CPU used the NUMA method for accessing memory on Itanium\narchitectures. A local unprivileged user could trigger this flaw and cause\na denial of service (system panic). (CVE-2007-4130, Important)\nA possible NULL pointer dereference was found in the chrp_show_cpuinfo\nfunction when using the PowerPC architecture. This may have allowed a local\nunprivileged user to cause a denial of service (crash).\n(CVE-2007-6694, Moderate)\nA flaw was found in the way core dump files were created. If a local user\ncan get a root-owned process to dump a core file into a directory, which\nthe user has write access to, they could gain read access to that core\nfile. This could potentially grant unauthorized access to sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2007-6206, Moderate)\nTwo buffer overflow flaws were found in the Linux kernel ISDN subsystem. A\nlocal unprivileged  user could use these flaws to cause a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2007-6063, CVE-2007-6151, Moderate)\nAs well, these updated packages fix the following bug:\n* when moving volumes that contain multiple segments, and a mirror segment\nis not the first in the mapping table, running the \"pvmove /dev/[device]\n/dev/[device]\" command caused a kernel panic. A \"kernel: Unable to handle\nkernel paging request at virtual address [address]\" error was logged by\nsyslog.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain backported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
