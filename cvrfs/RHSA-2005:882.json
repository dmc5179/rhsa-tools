With\ncertain site configurations, a remote attacker could perform a cross-site\nscripting attack if a victim can be forced to visit a malicious URL using\ncertain web browsers. (CVE-2005-3352) \nA flaw in mod_ssl triggered if a virtual host was configured using\n\"SSLVerifyClient optional\" and a directive \"SSLVerifyClient required\" is\nset for a specific location.  For servers configured in this fashion, an\nattacker may be able to access resources that should otherwise be\nprotected.  (CVE-2005-2700) \nFlaws in shmop_write, pack, and unpack PHP functions.  These functions are\nnot normally passed user-supplied data, so would require a malicious PHP\nscript to be exploited.  (CVE-2004-1018) \nVarious flaws, including possible information disclosure, double free, and\nnegative reference index array underflow in the deserialization code of\nPHP.  PHP applications may use the unserialize function of untrusted user\ndata, which could allow a remote attacker to gain access to memory or\npotentially execute arbitrary code.  (CVE-2004-1019) \nA flaw in the way PHP registers global variables during a file upload\nrequest.  A remote attacker could submit a carefully crafted\nmultipart/form-data POST request that would overwrite the $GLOBALS array,\naltering expected script behavior, and possibly leading to the execution of\narbitrary PHP commands. Note that this vulnerability only affects\ninstallations which have register_globals enabled in the PHP configuration\nfile, which is not a default or recommended option.  (CVE-2005-3390)\nA flaw in the PHP parse_str() function. If a PHP script passes only one\nargument to the parse_str() function, and the script can be forced to abort\nexecution during operation (for example due to the memory_limit setting),\nthe register_globals may be enabled even if it is disabled in the PHP\nconfiguration file. This vulnerability only affects installations that have\nPHP scripts using the parse_str function in this way. (CVE-2005-3389)\nA Cross-Site Scripting flaw in the phpinfo() function. If a victim can be\ntricked into following a malicious URL to a site with a page displaying the\nphpinfo() output, it may be possible to inject javascript or HTML content\ninto the displayed page or steal data such as cookies.  This vulnerability\nonly affects installations that allow users to view the output of the\nphpinfo() function.  As the phpinfo() function outputs a large amount of\ninformation about the current state of PHP, it should only be used during\ndebugging or if protected by authentication. (CVE-2005-3388) \nOpenSSL contained a software work-around for a bug in SSL handling in\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer version 3.0.2.  This work-around is enabled in\nmost servers that use OpenSSL to provide support for SSL and TLS.  Yutaka\nOiwa discovered that this work-around could allow an attacker, acting as a\n\"man in the middle\", to force an SSL connection to use SSL 2.0 rather than\na stronger protocol such as SSL 3.0 or TLS 1.0.  (CAN-2005-2969)\nColin Percival reported a cache timing attack that could allow a malicious\nlocal user to gain portions of cryptographic keys.  The OpenSSL library has\nbeen patched to add a new fixed-window mod_exp implementation as default\nfor RSA, DSA, and DH private-key operations.  This patch is designed to\nmitigate cache timing and potentially related attacks.  (CVE-2005-0109)\nStronghold users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\nresolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
