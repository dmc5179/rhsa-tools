A remote attacker could cause the PHP interpreter to crash by\nsubmitting an input variable with a deeply nested array. (CVE-2007-1285)\nA flaw was found in the way PHP's unserialize() function processes data. If\na remote attacker is able to pass arbitrary data to PHP's unserialize()\nfunction, it may be possible for them to execute arbitrary code as the\napache user. (CVE-2007-1286)\nA double free flaw was found in PHP's session_decode() function. If a\nremote attacker is able to pass arbitrary data to PHP's session_decode()\nfunction, it may be possible for them to execute arbitrary code as the\napache user. (CVE-2007-1711)\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
