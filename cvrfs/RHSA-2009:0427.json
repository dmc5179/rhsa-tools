Netlink is a datagram\noriented service, used to transfer information between kernel modules and\nuser-space processes.\nIt was discovered that udev did not properly check the origin of Netlink\nmessages. A local attacker could use this flaw to gain root privileges via\na crafted Netlink message sent to udev, causing it to create a\nworld-writable block device file for an existing system block device (for\nexample, the root file system). (CVE-2009-1185)\nRed Hat would like to thank Sebastian Krahmer of the SUSE Security Team for\nresponsibly reporting this flaw.\nUsers of udev are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the\nupdate, the udevd daemon will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
