If an attacker in control of a\nCVS repository stored a specially-crafted RCS file in that repository, and\nthen tricked a remote victim into checking out (updating their CVS\nrepository tree) a revision containing that file, it could lead to\narbitrary code execution with the privileges of the CVS server process\non the system hosting the CVS repository.
