This library is API and ABI compatible with\nlibungif, the library that supported uncompressed GIF image files while the\nUnisys LZW patent was in effect.\nSeveral flaws were discovered in the way giflib decodes GIF images. An\nattacker could create a carefully crafted GIF image that could cause an\napplication using giflib to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code when\nopened by a victim. (CVE-2005-2974, CVE-2005-3350)\nAll users of giflib are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve these issues. All running\napplications using giflib must be restarted for the update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
