A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,\nwhich gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in\nthe References section.","The nss_db packages provide a set of C library extensions which allow\nBerkeley Database (Berkeley DB) databases to be used as a primary source of\naliases, ethers, groups, hosts, networks, protocols, users, RPCs, services,\nand shadow passwords. These databases are used instead of or in addition to\nthe flat files used by these tools by default.\nIt was discovered that nss_db did not specify a path to the directory to be\nused as the database environment for the Berkeley Database library, causing\nit to use the current working directory as the default. This could possibly\nallow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2010-0826)\nUsers of nss_db are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to correct this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
