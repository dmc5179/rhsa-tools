It includes built-in PHP support for the IMAP and SMTP\nprotocols, and pure HTML 4.0 page-rendering (with no JavaScript required)\nfor maximum browser-compatibility, strong MIME support, address books, and\nfolder manipulation.\nIvan Markovic discovered a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw in SquirrelMail\ncaused by insufficient HTML mail sanitization. A remote attacker could send\na specially-crafted HTML mail or attachment that could cause a user's Web\nbrowser to execute a malicious script in the context of the SquirrelMail\nsession when that email or attachment was opened by the user.\n(CVE-2008-2379)\nIt was discovered that SquirrelMail allowed cookies over insecure\nconnections (ie did not restrict cookies to HTTPS connections). An attacker\nwho controlled the communication channel between a user and the\nSquirrelMail server, or who was able to sniff the user's network\ncommunication, could use this flaw to obtain the user's session cookie, if\na user made an HTTP request to the server. (CVE-2008-3663)\nNote: After applying this update, all session cookies set for SquirrelMail\nsessions started over HTTPS connections will have the \"secure\" flag set.\nThat is, browsers will only send such cookies over an HTTPS connection. If\nneeded, you can revert to the previous behavior by setting the\nconfiguration option \"$only_secure_cookies\" to \"false\" in SquirrelMail's\n/etc/squirrelmail/config.php configuration file.\nUsers of squirrelmail should upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
