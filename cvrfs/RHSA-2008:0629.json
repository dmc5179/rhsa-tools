This\nupdate includes fixes for a number of security issues in Red Hat Network\nSatellite Server Solaris client components.\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.","This release corrects several security vulnerabilities in components\nshipped as part of the Red Hat Network Satellite Server Solaris client. In\na typical operating environment, these components are not used by the\nSatellite Server in a vulnerable manner. These security updates will reduce\nrisk should these components be used by other applications.\nSeveral flaws in Zlib were discovered. An attacker could create a\ncarefully-crafted compressed stream that would cause an application to\ncrash if the stream was opened by a user. (CVE-2005-2096, CVE-2005-1849)\nA buffer overflow was discovered in the OpenSSL SSL_get_shared_ciphers()\nutility function. An attacker could send a list of ciphers to an\napplication that used this function and overrun a buffer (CVE-2006-3738).\nA flaw in the SSLv2 client code was discovered. If a client application\nused OpenSSL to create an SSLv2 connection to a malicious server, that\nserver could cause the client to crash. (CVE-2006-4343)\nAn attack on OpenSSL PKCS #1 v1.5 signatures was discovered. Where an RSA\nkey with exponent 3 was used an attacker could, potentially, forge a PKCS\n#1 v1.5 signature that would be incorrectly verified by implementations\nthat do not check for excess data in the RSA exponentiation result of the\nsignature. This issue affected applications that use OpenSSL to verify\nX.509 certificates as well as other uses of PKCS #1 v1.5. (CVE-2006-4339)\nOpenSSL contained a software work-around for a bug in SSL handling in\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer version 3.0.2. It is enabled in most servers\nthat use OpenSSL to provide support for SSL and TLS. This work-around was\nvulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack which allowed a remote user to\nforce an SSL connection to use SSL 2.0, rather than a stronger protocol,\nsuch as SSL 3.0 or TLS 1.0. (CVE-2005-2969)\nDuring OpenSSL parsing of certain invalid ASN.1 structures, an error\ncondition was mishandled. This could result in an infinite loop which\nconsumed system memory (CVE-2006-2937).\nCertain public key types could take disproportionate amounts of time to\nprocess in OpenSSL, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2006-2940)\nA flaw was discovered in the Python repr() function's handling of\nUTF-32/UCS-4 strings. If an application used the repr() function on\nuntrusted data, this could lead to a denial of service or, possibly, allow\nthe execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the application\nusing the flawed function. (CVE-2006-4980)\nA flaw was discovered in the strxfrm() function of Python's locale module.\nStrings generated by this function were not properly NULL-terminated. This\ncould, potentially, cause disclosure of data stored in the memory of an\napplication using this function. (CVE-2007-2052)\nMultiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in Python's imageop module.\nIf an application used the imageop module to process untrusted images, it\ncould cause the application to crash, enter an infinite loop, or, possibly,\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Python interpreter.\n(CVE-2007-4965)\nA stack-based buffer overflow was discovered in the Python interpreter,\nwhich could allow a local user to gain privileges by running a script with\na long name from the current working directory. (CVE-2006-1542)\nUsers of Red Hat Network Satellite Server should upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
