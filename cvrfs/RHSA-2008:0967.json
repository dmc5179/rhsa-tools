An attacker in control of\na Web server to which requests were being proxied could have caused a\nlimited denial of service due to CPU consumption and stack exhaustion.\n(CVE-2008-2364)\nA flaw was found in the mod_proxy_ftp Apache module. If Apache was\nconfigured to support FTP-over-HTTP proxying, a remote attacker could have\nperformed a cross-site scripting attack. (CVE-2008-2939)\nIn addition, these updated packages fix a bug found in the handling of the\n\"ProxyRemoteMatch\" directive in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 httpd\npackages. This bug is not present in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 or Red\nHat Enterprise Linux 5 packages.\nUsers of httpd should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
