An authenticated\nremote user could exploit this bug which may lead to arbitrary code\nexecution on the server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0882 to this issue. Red Hat\nbelieves that the Exec-Shield technology (enabled by default since Update\n3) will block attempts to remotely exploit this vulnerability on x86\narchitectures.\nAdditionally, a bug was found in the input validation routines in versions\nof Samba prior to 3.0.8 that caused the smbd process to consume abnormal\namounts of system memory.  An authenticated remote user could exploit this\nbug to cause a denial of service.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0930 to this issue.\nUsers of Samba should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported security patches, and are not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
