Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003:223"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Important","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated stunnel packages are now available.  These updates correct a\npotential vulnerability in stunnel's signal handling.","Stunnel is a wrapper for network connections.  It can be used to tunnel an\nunencrypted network connection over a secure connection (encrypted using\nSSL or TLS) or to provide a secure means of connecting to services that do\nnot natively support encryption.\nWhen configured to listen for incoming connections (instead of being\ninvoked by xinetd), stunnel can be configured to either start a thread or a\nchild process to handle each new connection. If Stunnel is configured to\nstart a new child process to handle each connection, it will receive a\nSIGCHLD signal when that child exits.\nStunnel versions prior to 4.04 would perform tasks in the SIGCHLD signal\nhandler which, if interrupted by another SIGCHLD signal, could be unsafe.\nThis could lead to a denial of service.\nAll users are urged to upgrade to these errata packages, which modify\nstunnel's signal handler so that it is not vulnerable to this issue.\nNOTE: After upgrading, any instances of stunnel configured to run in daemon\nmode should be restarted, and any active network connections that are\ncurrently being serviced by stunnel should be terminated and reestablished.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
