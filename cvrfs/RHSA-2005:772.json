It is\npossible for a remote user capable of connecting to the CUPS daemon to\nissue a malformed HTTP GET request that causes CUPS to enter an\ninfinite loop. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-2874 to this issue.\nTwo small bugs have also been fixed in this update.  A signal handling\nproblem has been fixed that could occasionally cause the scheduler to stop\nwhen told to reload.  A problem with tracking open file descriptors under\ncertain specific circumstances has also been fixed.\nAll users of CUPS should upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain a\npatch to correct this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
