The CAC is used by the U.S. Government.\nSteve Grubb discovered a flaw in the way coolkey created a temporary\ndirectory. A local attacker could perform a symlink attack and cause\narbitrary files to be overwritten. (CVE-2007-4129)\nIn addition, the updated packages contain fixes for the following bugs in\nthe CAC Smart Card support:\n* CAC Smart Cards can have from 1 to 3 certificates. The coolkey driver,\nhowever, was not recognizing cards if they had less than 3 certificates.\n* logging into a CAC Smart Card token with a new application would cause\nother, already authenticated, applications to lose their login status\nunless the Smart Card was then removed from the reader and re-inserted.\nAll CAC users should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve these\nissues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
