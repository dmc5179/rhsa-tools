This vulnerability\ncan allow a local user to gain root privileges.  An additional race\ncondition was found in versions of LogWatch 2.5 and earlier.\nUsers should update to the errata packages containing Logwatch 2.6, which\nare not vulnerable to these issues.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the names CAN-2002-0162 and CAN-2002-0165 to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
