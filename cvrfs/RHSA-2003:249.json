Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003:249"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Important","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated glibc packages that fix a number of bugs as well as a buffer\noverflow issue are now available.","The GNU libc package (known as glibc) contains the standard C libraries\nused by applications.\nA bug in the getgrouplist function can cause a buffer overflow if \nthe size of the group list is too small to hold all the user's groups. \nThis overflow can cause segmentation faults in user applications, which may\nhave security implications, depending on the application in question. This\nvulnerability exists only when an administrator has placed a user in a\nnumber of groups larger than that expected by an application.  Therefore,\nthere is no risk in instances where users are members of few groups.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2003-0689 to this issue.\nIn addition, a number of other bugs in glibc have been fixed:\n- An error prevented gdb from correctly debugging programs linked to\nlibpthread.                                                               \n- A race condition existed in the malloc routine for IA64 platforms, which\ncould cause memory corruption.\n- An error in pthread_spinlocks prevents spinlocks from functioning\ncorrectly on IA64 platforms.\nAll users should upgrade to these errata packages, which contain patches to\nthe glibc libraries correcting these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
