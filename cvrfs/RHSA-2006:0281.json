If it is possible\nfor a remote attacker to inject a CANCEL request during a validation\noperation, it may be possible for the attacker to acquire credentials\nwithout the proper authentication information. (CVE-2006-1546)\nA denial of service bug was found in the way Struts handles\nmultipart/form-data encoded form data. If it is possible for a remote\nattacker to reference the public getMultipartRequestHandler method, the\nattacker can prevent the Struts application from functioning properly.\n(CVE-2006-1547)\nA cross site scripting bug was found in the way Struts displays certain\nerror messages via its LookupDispatchAction, DispatchAction, and\nActionDispatcher handler. It may be possible for an attacker to construct a\nspecially crafted URL that could fool a victim into believing they are\nviewing a trusted site. (CVE-2006-1548)\nAll users of Struts should upgrade to this updated package containing \nStruts version 1.2.9, which is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
