This bug\ncould allow a remote Gopher server to crash the Squid proxy that reads data\nfrom it. Although Gopher servers are now quite rare, a malicious web page\n(for example) could redirect or contain a frame pointing to an attacker's\nmalicious gopher server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0094 to this issue.\nAn integer overflow flaw was found in the WCCP message parser. It is\npossible to crash the Squid server if an attacker is able to send a\nmalformed WCCP message with a spoofed source address matching Squid's\n\"home router\". The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0095 to this issue.\nA memory leak was found in the NTLM fakeauth_auth helper. It is possible\nthat an attacker could place the Squid server under high load, causing the\nNTML fakeauth_auth helper to consume a large amount of memory, resulting in\na denial of service. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0096 to this issue.\nA NULL pointer de-reference bug was found in the NTLM fakeauth_auth helper.\nIt is possible for an attacker to send a malformed NTLM type 3 message,\ncausing the Squid server to crash. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0097 to\nthis issue.\nA username validation bug was found in squid_ldap_auth. It is possible for\na username to be padded with spaces, which could allow a user to bypass\nexplicit access control rules or confuse accounting. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2005-0173 to this issue.\nThe way Squid handles HTTP responses was found to need strengthening. It is\npossible that a malicious web server could send a series of HTTP responses\nin such a way that the Squid cache could be poisoned, presenting users with\nincorrect webpages. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CAN-2005-0174 and CAN-2005-0175 to\nthese issues.\nA bug was found in the way Squid handled oversized HTTP response headers.\nIt is possible that a malicious web server could send a specially crafted\nHTTP header which could cause the Squid cache to be poisoned, presenting\nusers with incorrect webpages.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0241 to this issue.\nA buffer overflow bug was found in the WCCP message parser. It is possible\nthat an attacker could send a malformed WCCP message which could crash the\nSquid server or execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0211\nto this issue.\nUsers of Squid should upgrade to this updated package, which contains\nbackported patches, and is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
