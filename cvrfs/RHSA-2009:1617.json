In a typical\noperating environment, Tomcat is not exposed to users of Satellite Server\nin a vulnerable manner: By default, only Satellite Server applications are\nrunning on Tomcat. This update will reduce risk in unique Satellite Server\nenvironments.\nIt was discovered that request dispatchers did not properly normalize user\nrequests that have trailing query strings, allowing remote attackers to\nsend specially-crafted requests that would cause an information leak.\n(CVE-2008-5515)\nA flaw was found in the way the Tomcat AJP (Apache JServ Protocol)\nconnector processes AJP connections. An attacker could use this flaw to\nsend specially-crafted requests that would cause a temporary denial of\nservice. (CVE-2009-0033)\nIt was discovered that web applications containing their own XML parsers\ncould replace the XML parser Tomcat uses to parse configuration files. A\nmalicious web application running on a Tomcat instance could read or,\npotentially, modify the configuration and XML-based data of other web\napplications deployed on the same Tomcat instance. (CVE-2009-0783)\nUsers of Red Hat Network Satellite Server 5.1 are advised to upgrade to\nthis updated tomcat package, which contains backported patches to resolve\nthese issues. Tomcat must be restarted for this update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
