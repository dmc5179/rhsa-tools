A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\nbase score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the\nCVE link in the References section.","The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\nThis update fixes the following security issue:\n* when an application has a stack overflow, the stack could silently\noverwrite another memory mapped area instead of a segmentation fault\noccurring, which could cause an application to execute arbitrary code,\npossibly leading to privilege escalation. It is known that the X Window\nSystem server can be used to trigger this flaw. (CVE-2010-2240, Important)\nRed Hat would like to thank the X.Org security team for reporting this\nissue.
