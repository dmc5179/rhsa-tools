To exploit this issue an attacker would need to have the ability\nto write to Apache configuration files such as .htaccess or httpd.conf.  A\ncarefully-crafted configuration file can cause an exploitable buffer\noverflow and would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the\ncontext of the server (in default configurations as the 'apache' user).\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2003-0542 to this issue.\nA bug in the CGI daemon-based \"mod_cgid\" module was discovered that can\nresult in CGI script output being sent to the wrong client. This issue only\naffects Red Hat Linux 9, and only when the server is configured to use the\n\"worker\" MPM. The default configuration uses the \"mod_cgi\" module for CGI\nand is not affected by this issue. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0789 to this issue.\nUsers of the Apache HTTP Server should upgrade to these erratum packages,\nwhich contain backported patches correcting these issues, and are applied\nto Apache version 2.0.40.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
