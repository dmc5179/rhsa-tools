This is the eighth\nregular update.\nThese updated packages fix two security issues, hundreds of bugs, and add\nnumerous enhancements. Space precludes a detailed description of each of\nthese in this advisory. Refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.8 Release\nNotes for information on 22 of the most significant of these changes. For\nmore detailed information on specific bug fixes or enhancements, refer to\nthe Bugzilla numbers associated with this advisory.\nThis update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.","The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\nSecurity Fixes:\n* the exit_notify() function in the Linux kernel did not properly reset the\nexit signal if a process executed a set user ID (setuid) application before\nexiting. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to elevate their\nprivileges. (CVE-2009-1337, Important)\n* the Linux kernel implementation of the Network File System (NFS) did not\nproperly initialize the file name limit in the nfs_server data structure.\nThis flaw could possibly lead to a denial of service on a client mounting\nan NFS share. (CVE-2009-1336, Moderate)\nBug Fixes and Enhancements:\nKernel Feature Support:\n* added a new allowable value to \"/proc/sys/kernel/wake_balance\" to allow\nthe scheduler to run the thread on any available CPU rather than scheduling\nit on the optimal CPU.\n* added \"max_writeback_pages\" tunable parameter to /proc/sys/vm/ to allow\nthe maximum number of modified pages kupdate writes to disk, per iteration\nper run.\n* added \"swap_token_timeout\" tunable parameter to /proc/sys/vm/ to provide\na valid hold time for the swap out protection token.\n* added diskdump support to sata_svw driver.\n* limited physical memory to 64GB for 32-bit kernels running on systems\nwith more than 64GB of physical memory to prevent boot failures.\n* improved reliability of autofs.\n* added support for 'rdattr_error' in NFSv4 readdir requests.\n* fixed various short packet handling issues for NFSv4 readdir and sunrpc.\n* fixed several CIFS bugs.\nNetworking and IPv6 Enablement:\n* added router solicitation support.\n* enforced sg requires tx csum in ethtool.\nPlatform Support:\nx86, AMD64, Intel 64, IBM System z\n* added support for a new Intel chipset.\n* added initialization vendor info in boot_cpu_data.\n* added support for N_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV) for IBM System z guests\nusing zFCP.\n* added HDMI support for some AMD and ATI chipsets.\n* updated HDA driver in ALSA to latest upstream as of 2008-07-22.\n* added support for affected_cpus for cpufreq.\n* removed polling timer from i8042.\n* fixed PM-Timer when using the ASUS A8V Deluxe motherboard.\n* backported usbfs_mutex in usbfs.\n64-bit PowerPC:\n* updated eHEA driver from version 0078-04 to 0078-08.\n* updated logging of checksum errors in the eHEA driver.\nNetwork Driver Updates:\n* updated forcedeth driver to latest upstream version 0.61.\n* fixed various e1000 issues when using Intel ESB2 hardware.\n* updated e1000e driver to upstream version 0.3.3.3-k6.\n* updated igb to upstream version 1.2.45-k2.\n* updated tg3 to upstream version 3.96.\n* updated ixgbe to upstream version 1.3.18-k4.\n* updated bnx2 to upstream version 1.7.9.\n* updated bnx2x to upstream version 1.45.23.\n* fixed bugs and added enhancements for the NetXen NX2031 and NX3031\nproducts.\n* updated Realtek r8169 driver to support newer network chipsets. All\nvariants of RTL810x/RTL8168(9) are now supported.\nStorage Driver Updates:\n* fixed various SCSI issues. Also, the SCSI sd driver now calls the\nrevalidate_disk wrapper.\n* fixed a dmraid reduced I/O delay bug in certain configurations.\n* removed quirk aac_quirk_scsi_32 for some aacraid controllers.\n* updated FCP driver on IBM System z systems with support for\npoint-to-point connections.\n* updated lpfc to version 8.0.16.46.\n* updated megaraid_sas to version 4.01-RH1.\n* updated MPT Fusion driver to version 3.12.29.00rh.\n* updated qla2xxx firmware to 4.06.01 for 4GB/s and 8GB/s adapters.\n* updated qla2xxx driver to version 8.02.09.00.04.08-d.\n* fixed sata_nv in libsata to disable ADMA mode by default.\nMiscellaneous Updates:\n* upgraded OpenFabrics Alliance Enterprise Distribution (OFED) to version\n1.4.\n* added driver support and fixes for various Wacom tablets.\nUsers should install this update, which resolves these issues and adds\nthese enhancements.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
