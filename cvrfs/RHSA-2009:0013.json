It facilitates service discovery on\na local network. Avahi and Avahi-aware applications allow you to plug your\ncomputer into a network and, with no configuration, view other people to\nchat with, see printers to print to, and find shared files on other computers.\nHugo Dias discovered a denial of service flaw in avahi-daemon. A remote\nattacker on the same local area network (LAN) could send a\nspecially-crafted mDNS (Multicast DNS) packet that would cause avahi-daemon\nto exit unexpectedly due to a failed assertion check. (CVE-2008-5081)\nAll users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a\nbackported patch which resolves this issue. After installing the update,\navahi-daemon will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
