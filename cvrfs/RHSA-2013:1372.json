A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,\nwhich gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in\nthe References section.","JBoss Remoting is a framework for building distributed applications in\nJava.\nA denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of the\norg.jboss.remoting.transport.socket.ServerThread class in JBoss Remoting.\nAn attacker could use this flaw to exhaust all available file descriptors\non the target server, preventing legitimate connections. Note that to\nexploit this flaw remotely, the remoting port must be exposed directly or\nindirectly (for example, deploying a public facing application that uses\nJBoss Remoting could indirectly expose this flaw). (CVE-2013-4210)\nThis issue was discovered by James Livingston of the Red Hat Support\nEngineering Group.\nWarning: Before applying this update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss\nWeb Platform installation (including all applications and configuration\nfiles).\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Web Platform 5.2.0 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to apply this update.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
