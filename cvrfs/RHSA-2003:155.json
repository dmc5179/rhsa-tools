Three\nbugs have been found in the header parsing code in Fetchmail versions \nprior to 6.2.0:\nA heap-based buffer overflow in Fetchmail 6.1.3 and earlier does not\naccount for the \"@\" character when determining buffer lengths for local\naddresses, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a\nheader with a large number of local addresses.\nBuffer overflows in Fetchmail 6.0.0 and earlier allow remote attackers to\ncause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via long\nheaders that are not properly processed by the readheaders function, or \nvia long Received: headers, which are not properly parsed by the\nparse_received function.\nThe getmxrecord function in Fetchmail 6.0.0 and earlier does not properly\ncheck the boundary of a particular malformed DNS packet from a malicious\nDNS server, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n(crash) when Fetchmail attempts to read data beyond the expected boundary.\nAll users of Fetchmail are advised to upgrade to the errata packages\ncontaining a backported fix, which is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
