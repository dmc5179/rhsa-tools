Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4\ncontains checks within glibc that detect double-free flaws.  Therefore, on\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 4 successful exploitation of this issue can only\nlead to a denial of service (KDC crash).  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project assigned the name CAN-2005-1689 to this issue.\nDaniel Wachdorf discovered a single byte heap overflow in the\nkrb5_unparse_name() function, part of krb5-libs.  Sucessful exploitation of\nthis flaw would lead to a denial of service (crash).  To trigger this flaw\nan attacker would need to have control of a kerberos realm that shares a\ncross-realm key with the target, making exploitation of this flaw unlikely.\n(CAN-2005-1175).\nDaniel Wachdorf also discovered that in error conditions that may occur in\nresponse to correctly-formatted client requests, the Kerberos 5 KDC may\nattempt to free uninitialized memory.  This could allow a remote attacker\nto cause a denial of service (KDC crash) (CAN-2005-1174).\nGaël Delalleau discovered an information disclosure issue in the way\nsome telnet clients handle messages from a server. An attacker could\nconstruct a malicious telnet server that collects information from the\nenvironment of any victim who connects to it using the Kerberos-aware\ntelnet client (CAN-2005-0488).\nThe rcp protocol allows a server to instruct a client to write to arbitrary\nfiles outside of the current directory. This could potentially cause a\nsecurity issue if a user uses the Kerberos-aware rcp to copy files from a\nmalicious server (CAN-2004-0175).\nAll users of krb5 should update to these erratum packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.  Red Hat would like to thank\nthe MIT Kerberos Development Team for their responsible disclosure of these\nissues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
