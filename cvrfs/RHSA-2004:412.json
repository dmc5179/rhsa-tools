A local attacker could\nprevent KDE applications from functioning correctly, or overwrite files\nowned by other users by creating malicious symlinks.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name CAN-2004-0689\nto this issue.\nWESTPOINT internet reconnaissance services has discovered that the KDE web\nbrowser Konqueror allows websites to set cookies for certain country\nspecific secondary top level domains.  An attacker within one of the\naffected domains could construct a cookie which would be sent to all other\nwebsites within the domain leading to a session fixation attack.  This\nissue does not affect popular domains such as .co.uk, .co.in, or .com.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0721 to this issue.\nA frame injection spoofing vulnerability has been discovered in the\nKonqueror web browser.  This issue could allow a malicious website to show\narbitrary content in a named frame of a different browser window.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0746 to this issue.\nAll users of KDE are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages,\nwhich contain backported patches from the KDE team for these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
