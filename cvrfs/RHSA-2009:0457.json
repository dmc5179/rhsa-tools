An attacker could create a specially-crafted WMF file that would\ncause an application using libwmf to crash or, potentially, execute\narbitrary code as the user running the application when opened by a victim.\n(CVE-2009-1364)\nNote: This flaw is specific to the GD graphics library embedded in libwmf.\nIt does not affect the GD graphics library from the \"gd\" packages, or\napplications using it.\nRed Hat would like to thank Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team for\nresponsibly reporting this flaw.\nAll users of libwmf are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the\nupdate, all applications using libwmf must be restarted for the update\nto take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
