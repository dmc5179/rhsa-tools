A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,\nwhich gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in\nthe References section.","LFTP is a sophisticated file transfer program for the FTP and HTTP\nprotocols. Like Bash, it has job control and uses the Readline library for\ninput. It has bookmarks, built-in mirroring, and can transfer several files\nin parallel. It is designed with reliability in mind.\nIt was discovered that lftp trusted the file name provided in the\nContent-Disposition HTTP header. A malicious HTTP server could use this\nflaw to write or overwrite files in the current working directory of a\nvictim running lftp, by sending a different file from what the victim\nrequested. (CVE-2010-2251)\nTo correct this flaw, the following changes were made to lftp: the\n\"xfer:clobber\" option now defaults to \"no\", causing lftp to not overwrite\nexisting files, and a new option, \"xfer:auto-rename\", which defaults to\n\"no\", has been introduced to control whether lftp should use\nserver-suggested file names. Refer to the \"Settings\" section of the lftp(1)\nmanual page for additional details on changing lftp settings.\nAll lftp users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a\nbackported patch to correct this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
