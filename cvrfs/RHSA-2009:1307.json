It is transparent to the\nunderlying file system and provides per-file granularity.\neCryptfs is released as a Technology Preview for Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n5.4. These updated ecryptfs-utils packages have been upgraded to upstream\nversion 75, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the\nprevious version. In addition, these packages provide a graphical program\nto help configure and use eCryptfs. To start this program, run the command:\necryptfs-mount-helper-gui\nImportant: the syntax of certain eCryptfs mount options has changed. Users\nwho were previously using the initial Technology Preview release of\necryptfs-utils are advised to refer to the ecryptfs(7) man page, and to\nupdate any affected mount scripts and /etc/fstab entries for eCryptfs file\nsystems.\nA disclosure flaw was found in the way the \"ecryptfs-setup-private\" script\npassed passphrases to the \"ecryptfs-wrap-passphrase\" and\n\"ecryptfs-add-passphrase\" commands as command line arguments. A local user\ncould obtain the passphrases of other users who were running the script\nfrom the process listing. (CVE-2008-5188)\nThese updated packages provide various enhancements, including a mount\nhelper and supporting libraries to perform key management and mounting\nfunctions.\nNotable enhancements include:\n* a new package, ecryptfs-utils-gui, has been added to this update. This\npackage depends on the pygtk2 and pygtk2-libglade packages and provides the\neCryptfs Mount Helper GUI program. To install the GUI, first install\necryptfs-utils and then issue the following command:\nyum install ecryptfs-utils-gui\n(BZ#500997)\n* the \"ecryptfs-rewrite-file\" utility is now more intelligent when dealing\nwith non-existent files and with filtering special files such as the \".\"\ndirectory. In addition, the progress output from \"ecryptfs-rewrite-file\"\nhas been improved and is now more explicit about the success status of each\ntarget. (BZ#500813)\n* descriptions of the \"verbose\" flag and the \"verbosity=[x]\" option, where\n[x] is either 0 or 1, were missing from a number of eCryptfs manual pages,\nand have been added. Refer to the eCryptfs man pages for important\ninformation regarding using the verbose and/or verbosity options.\n(BZ#470444)\nThese updated packages also fix the following bugs:\n* mounting a directory using the eCryptfs mount helper with an RSA key that\nwas too small did not allow the eCryptfs mount helper to encrypt the entire\nkey. When this situation occurred, the mount helper did not display an\nerror message alerting the user to the fact that the key size was too\nsmall, possibly leading to corrupted files. The eCryptfs mount helper now\nrefuses RSA keys which are to small to encrypt the eCryptfs key.\n(BZ#499175)\n* when standard input was redirected from /dev/null or was unavailable,\nattempting to mount a directory with the eCryptfs mount helper caused it to\nbecome unresponsive and eventually crash, or an \"invalid value\" error\nmessage, depending on if the \"--verbosity=[value]\" option was provided as\nan argument, and, if so, its value. With these updated packages, attempting\nto mount a directory using \"mount.ecryptfs\" under the same conditions\nresults in either the mount helper attempting to use default values (if\n\"verbosity=0\" is supplied), or an \"invalid value\" error message (instead of\nthe mount helper hanging) if standard input is redirected and\n\"--verbosity=1\" is supplied, or that option is omitted entirely.\n(BZ#499367)\n* attempting to use the eCryptfs mount helper with an OpenSSL key when the\nkeyring did not contain enough space for the key resulted in an unhelpful\nerror message. The user is now alerted when this situation occurs.\n(BZ#501460)\n* the eCryptfs mount helper no longer fails upon receiving an incorrect or\nempty answer to \"yes/no\" questions. (BZ#466210)\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these updated ecryptfs-utils packages,\nwhich resolve these issues and add these enhancements.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
