The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0156 to\nthis issue.\nKevin Finisterre discovered a flaw in sperl which can cause debugging\ninformation to be logged to arbitrary files.  By setting an environment\nvariable, a local user could cause sperl to create, as root, files with\narbitrary filenames, or append the debugging information to existing files.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2005-0155 to this issue.\nAn unsafe file permission bug was discovered in the rmtree() function in\nthe File::Path module.  The rmtree() function removes files and directories\nin an insecure manner, which could allow a local user to read or delete\narbitrary files. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0452 to this issue.\nUsers of Perl are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
