This is the first regular update.","The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating\nsystem.\nThis is the first regular kernel update for Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux version 3.  It contains a new critical security fix, many\nother bug fixes, several device driver updates, and numerous\nperformance and scalability enhancements.\nOn AMD64 systems, a fix was made to the eflags checking in\n32-bit ptrace emulation that could have allowed local users\nto elevate their privileges.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0001 to this issue.\nOther bug fixes were made in the following kernel areas:\nVM, NPTL, IPC, kernel timer, ext3, NFS, netdump, SCSI,\nACPI, several device drivers, and machine-dependent\nsupport for the x86_64, ppc64, and s390 architectures.\nThe VM subsystem was improved to better handle extreme\nloads and resource contention (such as might occur during\nheavy database application usage).  This has resulted in\na significantly reduced possibility of hangs, OOM kills,\nand low-mem exhaustion.\nSeveral NPTL fixes were made to resolve POSIX compliance\nissues concerning process IDs and thread IDs.  A section\nin the Release Notes elaborates on a related issue with\nfile record locking in multi-threaded applications.\nAMD64 kernels are now configured with NUMA support,\nS390 kernels now have CONFIG_BLK_STATS enabled, and\nDMA capability was restored in the IA64 agpgart driver.\nThe following drivers have been upgraded to new versions:\ncmpci ------ 6.36\ne100 ------- 2.3.30-k1\ne1000 ------ 5.2.20-k1\nips -------- 6.10.52\nmegaraid --- v1.18k\nmegaraid2 -- v2.00.9\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 users are advised to upgrade\ntheir kernels to the packages associated with their machine\narchitectures and configurations as listed in this erratum.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
