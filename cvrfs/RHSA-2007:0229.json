If a user loaded an executable containing\nmalicious debugging information into GDB, an attacker might be able to\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. (CVE-2006-4146)\nThis updated package also addresses the following issues:\n* Fixed bogus 0x0 unwind of the thread's topmost function clone(3).\n* Fixed deadlock accessing invalid address; for corrupted backtraces.\n* Fixed a race which occasionally left the detached processes stopped.\n* Fixed 'gcore' command for 32bit debugged processes on 64bit hosts.\n* Added support for TLS 'errno' for threaded programs missing its '-debuginfo' package..\n* Suggest TLS 'errno' resolving by hand if no threading was found..\n* Added a fix to prevent stepping into asynchronously invoked signal handlers.\n* Added a fix to avoid false warning on shared objects bfd close on Itanium.\n* Fixed segmentation fault on the source display by ^X 1.\n* Fixed object names keyboard completion.\n* Added a fix to avoid crash of 'info threads' if stale threads exist.\n* Fixed a bug where shared libraries occasionally failed to load .\n* Fixed handling of exec() called by a threaded debugged program.\n* Fixed rebuilding requirements of the gdb package itself on multilib systems.\n* Fixed source directory pathname detection for the edit command.\nAll users of gdb should upgrade to this updated package, which contains\nbackported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
