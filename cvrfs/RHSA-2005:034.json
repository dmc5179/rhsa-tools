The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2005-0064 to this issue.\nDuring a source code audit, Chris Evans and others discovered a number of\ninteger overflow bugs that affected all versions of Xpdf.

This issue was assigned the\nname CAN-2004-0888 by The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org).  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 contained a fix for this\nissue, but it was found to be incomplete and left 64-bit architectures\nvulnerable.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0206 to this issue.\nAll users of Xpdf should upgrade to this updated package, which contains\nbackported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
