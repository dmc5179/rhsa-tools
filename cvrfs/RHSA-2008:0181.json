(CVE-2008-0062, CVE-2008-0063)\nThis issue only affected krb5kdc with Kerberos v4 protocol compatibility\nenabled, which is the default setting on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.\nKerberos v4 protocol support can be disabled by adding \"v4_mode=none\"\n(without the quotes) to the \"[kdcdefaults]\" section of\n/var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kdc.conf.\nA flaw was found in the RPC library used by the MIT Kerberos kadmind\nserver. An unauthenticated remote attacker could use this flaw to crash\nkadmind. This issue only affected systems with certain resource limits\nconfigured and did not affect systems using default resource limits used by\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 or 3. (CVE-2008-0948)\nRed Hat would like to thank MIT for reporting these issues.\nAll krb5 users are advised to update to these erratum packages which\ncontain backported fixes to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
