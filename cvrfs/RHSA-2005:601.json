It is possible for a malicious HTML\nmail to capture a random block of client memory. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned this bug the name\nCAN-2005-0989.\nA bug was found in the way Thunderbird validated several XPInstall related\nJavaScript objects. A malicious HTML mail could pass other objects to the\nXPInstall objects, resulting in the JavaScript interpreter jumping to\narbitrary locations in memory. (CAN-2005-1159)\nA bug was found in the way the Thunderbird privileged UI code handled DOM\nnodes from the content window. An HTML message could install malicious\nJavaScript code or steal data when a user performs commonplace actions such\nas clicking a link or opening the context menu. (CAN-2005-1160)\nA bug was found in the way Thunderbird executed JavaScript code. JavaScript\nexecuted from HTML mail should run with a restricted access level,\npreventing dangerous actions. It is possible that a malicious HTML mail\ncould execute JavaScript code with elevated privileges, allowing access to\nprotected data and functions. (CAN-2005-1532)\nA bug was found in the way Thunderbird executed Javascript in XBL controls.\nIt is possible for a malicious HTML mail to leverage this vulnerability to\nexecute other JavaScript based attacks even when JavaScript is disabled.\n(CAN-2005-2261)\nA bug was found in the way Thunderbird handled certain Javascript\nfunctions. It is possible for a malicious HTML mail to crash the client by\nexecuting malformed Javascript code. (CAN-2005-2265)\nA bug was found in the way Thunderbird handled child frames. It is possible\nfor a malicious framed HTML mail to steal sensitive information from its\nparent frame. (CAN-2005-2266) \nA bug was found in the way Thunderbird handled DOM node names. It is\npossible for a malicious HTML mail to overwrite a DOM node name, allowing\ncertain privileged chrome actions to execute the malicious JavaScript.\n(CAN-2005-2269)\nA bug was found in the way Thunderbird cloned base objects. It is possible\nfor HTML content to navigate up the prototype chain to gain access to\nprivileged chrome objects. (CAN-2005-2270) \nUsers of Thunderbird are advised to upgrade to this updated package that\ncontains Thunderbird version 1.0.6 and is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
