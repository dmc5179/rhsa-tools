MySQL is a\nclient/server implementation consisting of a server daemon (mysqld), and\nmany different client programs and libraries.\nA flaw was found in a way MySQL handled symbolic links when database tables\nwere created with explicit \"DATA\" and \"INDEX DIRECTORY\" options. An\nauthenticated user could create a table that would overwrite tables in\nother databases, causing destruction of data or allowing the user to\nelevate privileges. (CVE-2007-5969)\nA flaw was found in a way MySQL's InnoDB engine handled spatial indexes. An\nauthenticated user could create a table with spatial indexes, which are not\nsupported by the InnoDB engine, that would cause the mysql daemon to crash\nwhen used. This issue only causes a temporary denial of service, as the\nmysql daemon will be automatically restarted after the crash.\n(CVE-2007-5925)\nA flaw was found in a way MySQL handled the \"DEFINER\" view parameter. A\nuser with the \"ALTER VIEW\" privilege for a view created by another database\nuser, could modify that view to get access to any data accessible to the\ncreator of said view. (CVE-2007-6303)\nAll mysql users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
