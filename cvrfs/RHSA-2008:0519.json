If an unsuccessful attempt to copy kernel\nmemory from source to destination memory locations occurred, the copy\nroutines did not zero the content at the destination memory location. This\ncould allow a local unprivileged user to view potentially sensitive data.\n(CVE-2008-2729, Important)\n* Tavis Ormandy discovered a deficiency in the Linux kernel 32-bit and\n64-bit emulation. This could allow a local unprivileged user to prepare and\nrun a specially crafted binary, which would use this deficiency to leak\nuninitialized and potentially sensitive data. (CVE-2008-0598, Important)\n* Brandon Edwards discovered a missing length validation check in the Linux\nkernel DCCP module reconciliation feature. This could allow a local\nunprivileged user to cause a heap overflow, gaining privileges for\narbitrary code execution. (CVE-2008-2358, Moderate)\nAs well, these updated packages fix the following bug:\n* Due to a regression, \"gettimeofday\" may have gone backwards on certain\nx86 hardware. This issue was quite dangerous for time-sensitive systems,\nsuch as those used for transaction systems and databases, and may have\ncaused applications to produce incorrect results, or even crash.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5 users are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain backported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
