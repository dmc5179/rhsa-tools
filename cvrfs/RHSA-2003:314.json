A remote\nattacker who is able to influence the data passed to the to_ascii functions\nmay be able to execute arbitrary code in the context of the PostgreSQL\nserver. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\nhas assigned the name CAN-2003-0901 to these issues.\nIn addition, a bug that can lead to leaks has been found in the string to\ntimestamp abstract data type conversion routine.  If the input string to\nthe to_timestamp() routine is shorter than what the template string is\nexpecting, the routine will run off the end of the input string, resulting\nin a leak and unstable behaviour.\nUsers of PostgreSQL are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain a backported patch that corrects these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
