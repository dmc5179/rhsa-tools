If an LDAP server responded to an\nauthentication request with a PasswordPolicyResponse control, it was\npossible for an application using nss_ldap to improperly authenticate\ncertain users. (CVE-2006-5170)\nThis flaw was only exploitable within applications which did not properly\nprocess nss_ldap error messages. Only xscreensaver is currently known to\nexhibit this behavior.\nAll users of nss_ldap should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch that resolves this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
