This\ncould have allowed a local unprivileged user to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2007-6716, Important)\n* when running ptrace in 31-bit mode on an IBM S/390 or IBM System z\nkernel, a local unprivileged user could cause a denial of service by\nreading from or writing into a padding area in the user_regs_struct32\nstructure. (CVE-2008-1514, Important)\n* the do_truncate() and generic_file_splice_write() functions did not clear\nthe setuid and setgid bits. This could have allowed a local unprivileged\nuser to obtain access to privileged information. (CVE-2008-4210, Important)\n* Tobias Klein reported a missing check in the Linux kernel's Open Sound\nSystem (OSS) implementation. This deficiency could have led to an\ninformation leak. (CVE-2008-3272, Moderate)\n* a potential denial of service attack was discovered in the Linux kernel's\nPWC USB video driver. A local unprivileged user could have used this flaw\nto bring the kernel USB subsystem into the busy-waiting state.\n(CVE-2007-5093, Low)\n* the ext2 and ext3 file systems code failed to properly handle corrupted\ndata structures, leading to a possible local denial of service issue when\nread or write operations were performed. (CVE-2008-3528, Low)\nIn addition, these updated packages fix the following bugs:\n* when using the CIFS \"forcedirectio\" option, appending to an open file on\na CIFS share resulted in that file being overwritten with the data to be\nappended.\n* a kernel panic occurred when a device with PCI ID 8086:10c8 was present\non a system with a loaded ixgbe driver.\n* due to an aacraid driver regression, the kernel failed to boot when trying\nto load the aacraid driver and printed the following error message:\n\"aac_srb: aac_fib_send failed with status: 8195\".\n* due to an mpt driver regression, when RAID 1 was configured on Primergy\nsystems with an LSI SCSI IME 53C1020/1030 controller, the kernel panicked\nduring boot.\n* the mpt driver produced a large number of extraneous debugging messages\nwhen performing a \"Host reset\" operation.\n* due to a regression in the sym driver, the kernel panicked when a SCSI\nhot swap was performed using MCP18 hardware.\n* all cores on a multi-core system now scale their frequencies in\naccordance with the policy set by the system's CPU frequency governor.\n* the netdump subsystem suffered from several stability issues. These are\naddressed in this updated kernel.\n* under certain conditions, the ext3 file system reported a negative count\nof used blocks.\n* reading /proc/self/mem incorrectly returned \"Invalid argument\" instead of\n\"input/output error\" due to a regression.\n* under certain conditions, the kernel panicked when a USB device was\nremoved while the system was busy accessing the device.\n* a race condition in the kernel could have led to a kernel crash during\nthe creation of a new process.\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Users should upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
