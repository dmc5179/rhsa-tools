If a\nvictim opened a specially-crafted DCM or XWD file, an attacker could\npotentially execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. (CVE-2007-1797) \nSeveral denial of service flaws were found in ImageMagick's parsing of XCF\nand DCM files. Attempting to process a specially crafted input file in\nthese formats could cause ImageMagick to enter an infinite loop.\n(CVE-2007-4985) \nSeveral integer overflow flaws were found in ImageMagick. If a victim\nopened a specially-crafted DCM, DIB, XBM, XCF or XWD file, an attacker\ncould potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user\nrunning ImageMagick. (CVE-2007-4986)\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in ImageMagick's processing of\ncertain malformed PCX images. If a victim opened a specially-crafted PCX\nfile, an attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges\nof the user running ImageMagick.. (CVE-2008-1097)\nAll users of ImageMagick should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
