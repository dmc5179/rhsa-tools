A flaw was\nfound in the handling of the epsf command used to insert inline EPS files\ninto a document.  An attacker could create a carefully crafted ASCII file\nwhich made use of the epsf pipe command in such a way that it could execute\narbitrary commands if the file was opened with enscript by a victim.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2004-1184 to this issue.\nAdditional flaws in Enscript were also discovered which can only be\ntriggered by executing enscript with carefully crafted command line\narguments.  These flaws therefore only have a security impact if enscript\nis executed by other programs and passed untrusted data from remote users.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the names CAN-2004-1185 and CAN-2004-1186 to these issues.\nAll users of enscript should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
