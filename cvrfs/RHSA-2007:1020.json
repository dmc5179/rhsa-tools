A remote attacker who is able to connect to the IPP TCP port\ncould send a malicious request causing the CUPS daemon to crash, or\npotentially execute arbitrary code. Please note that the default CUPS\nconfiguration does not allow remote hosts to connect to the IPP TCP port.\n(CVE-2007-4351)\nRed Hat would like to thank Alin Rad Pop for reporting this issue.\nAll CUPS users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to resolve this issue.\nIn addition, the following bugs were fixed:\n* the CUPS service has been changed to start after sshd, to avoid causing\ndelays when logging in when the system is booted.\n* the logrotate settings have been adjusted so they do not cause CUPS to\nreload its configuration. This is to avoid re-printing the current job,\nwhich could occur when it was a long-running job.\n* a bug has been fixed in the handling of the If-Modified-Since: HTTP\nheader.\n* in the LSPP configuration, labels for labeled jobs did not line-wrap.\nThis has been fixed.\n* an access check in the LSPP configuration has been made more secure.\n* the cups-lpd service no longer ignores the \"-odocument-format=...\"\noption.\n* a memory allocation bug has been fixed in cupsd.\n* support for UNIX domain sockets authentication without passwords has been\nadded.\n* in the LSPP configuration, a problem that could lead to cupsd crashing\nhas been fixed.\n* the error handling in the initscript has been improved.\n* The job-originating-host-name attribute was not correctly set for jobs\nsubmitted via the cups-lpd service. This has been fixed.\n* a problem with parsing IPv6 addresses in the configuration file has been\nfixed.\n* a problem that could lead to cupsd crashing when it failed to open a\n\"file:\" URI has been fixed.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
