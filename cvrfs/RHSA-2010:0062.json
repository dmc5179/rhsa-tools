BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver\nlibrary (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and\ntools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.\nA flaw was found in the BIND DNSSEC NSEC/NSEC3 validation code. If BIND was\nrunning as a DNSSEC-validating resolver, it could incorrectly cache\nNXDOMAIN responses, as if they were valid, for records proven by NSEC or\nNSEC3 to exist. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a BIND\nserver to return the bogus, cached NXDOMAIN responses for valid records and\nprevent users from retrieving those records (denial of service).\n(CVE-2010-0097)\nThe original fix for CVE-2009-4022 was found to be incomplete. BIND was\nincorrectly caching certain responses without performing proper DNSSEC\nvalidation. CNAME and DNAME records could be cached, without proper DNSSEC\nvalidation, when received from processing recursive client queries that\nrequested DNSSEC records but indicated that checking should be disabled. A\nremote attacker could use this flaw to bypass the DNSSEC validation check\nand perform a cache poisoning attack if the target BIND server was\nreceiving such client queries. (CVE-2010-0290)\nAll BIND users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to resolve these issues. After installing the\nupdate, the BIND daemon (named) will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
