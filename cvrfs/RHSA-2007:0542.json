(CVE-2007-4570)\nThis update also fixes a problem where the mcstrans daemon was preventing\nSSH connections into an SELinux box, that was running a Multi-Level\nSecurity (MLS) Policy with multiple categories.\nUsers of mcstrans are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\nresolves this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
