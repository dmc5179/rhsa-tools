The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0055 to this issue.\nRemote attackers could potentially exploit these issues by sending\ncarefully-crafted packets to a victim.  If the victim uses tcpdump, these\npakets could result in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode as the 'pcap' user.\nUsers of tcpdump are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain backported security patches and are not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
