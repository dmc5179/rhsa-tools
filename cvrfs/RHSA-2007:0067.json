An authenticated user could execute a sequence of\ncommand which could crash the PostgreSQL server or possibly read from\narbitrary memory locations. A user must have permissions to drop and add\ndatabase tables to exploit this flaw. (CVE-2007-0555, CVE-2007-0556)\nSeveral denial of service flaws were found in the PostgreSQL server. An\nauthenticated user could execute an SQL command which could crash the\nPostgreSQL server. (CVE-2006-5540, CVE-2006-5541, CVE-2006-5542)\nUsers of PostgreSQL should upgrade to these updated packages containing\nPostgreSQL version 8.1.7, which corrects these issues.  \nNote: The original PostgreSQL 8.1.7 security patch contained an error; this\nrelease includes the updated patch and so is equivalent to the\nsoon-to-be-released 8.1.8.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
