A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\nbase score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the\nCVE link in the References section.","Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit combines popular open source web frameworks\ninto a single solution for Java applications. Seam is an open source\ndevelopment platform for building rich Internet applications in Java.\nSeam integrates technologies such as Asynchronous JavaScript and XML\n(AJAX), JavaServer Faces (JSF), Java Persistence API (JPA), and Enterprise\nJava Beans (EJB). Seam 2.3 provides support for JSF 2, RichFaces 4, and JPA\n2 capabilities, running on top of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application\nPlatform 6.\nIt was found that the org.jboss.seam.web.AuthenticationFilter class\nimplementation did not properly use Seam logging. A remote attacker could\nsend specially crafted authentication headers to an application, which\ncould result in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user\nrunning that application. (CVE-2014-0248)\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.5.0 as provided from the Red\nHat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
