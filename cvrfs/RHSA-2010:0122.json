If a local user were authorized by the sudoers file to use\nthis pseudo-command, they could possibly leverage this flaw to execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the root user. (CVE-2010-0426)\nThe sudo utility did not properly initialize supplementary groups when the\n\"runas_default\" option (in the sudoers file) was used. If a local user\nwere authorized by the sudoers file to perform their sudo commands under\nthe account specified with \"runas_default\", they would receive the root\nuser's supplementary groups instead of those of the intended target user,\ngiving them unintended privileges. (CVE-2010-0427)\nUsers of sudo should upgrade to this updated package, which contains\nbackported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
