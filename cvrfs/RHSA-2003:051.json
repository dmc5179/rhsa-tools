The MIT Kerberos team\nreleased an advisory describing a number of vulnerabilities that affect the\nkerberos packages shipped by Red Hat. These vulnerabilities include:\nAn integer signedness error in the ASN.1 decoder before version 1.2.5\nallows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a large\nunsigned data element length, which is later used as a negative value. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name\nCAN-2002-0036 to this issue. Red Hat Linux 8.0 and later are not affected\nby this issue.\nThe Key Distribution Center (KDC) before version 1.2.5 allows remote,\nauthenticated attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) on KDCs within\nthe same realm using a certain protocol request that causes a null\ndereference (CAN-2003-0058). Red Hat Linux 8.0 and later are not affected\nby this issue.\nThe Key Distribution Center (KDC) allows remote, authenticated attackers to\ncause a denial of service (crash) on KDCs within the same realm using a\ncertain protocol request that causes an out-of-bounds read of an array\n(CAN-2003-0072).\nThe Key Distribution Center (KDC) allows remote, authenticated attackers\nto cause a denial of service (crash) on KDCs within the same realm using a\ncertain protocol request that causes the KDC to corrupt its heap\n(CAN-2003-0082).\nA vulnerability in Kerberos before version 1.2.3 allows users from one\nrealm to impersonate users in other realms that have the same inter-realm\nkeys (CAN-2003-0059). Red Hat Linux 7.3 and later are not affected by this\nissue.\nThe MIT advisory for these issues also mentions format string\nvulnerabilities in the logging routines (CAN-2003-0060). Previous versions\nof the kerberos packages from Red Hat already contain fixes for this issue.\nVulnerabilities have been found in the support for triple-DES keys in the\nimplementation of the Kerberos IV authentication protocol which is included\nin MIT Kerberos (CAN-2003-0139).\nVulnerabilities have been found in the Kerberos IV authentication protocol\nwhich allow an attacker with knowledge of a cross-realm key, which is\nshared with another realm, to impersonate any principal in that realm to\nany service in that realm. This vulnerability can only be closed by\ndisabling cross-realm authentication in Kerberos IV (CAN-2003-0138).\nVulnerabilities have been found in the RPC library used by the kadmin\nservice in Kerberos 5. A faulty length check in the RPC library exposes\nkadmind to an integer overflow which can be used to crash kadmind\n(CAN-2003-0028).\nAll users of Kerberos are advised to upgrade to these errata packages,\nwhich disable cross-realm authentication by default for Kerberos IV and\nwhich contain backported patches that correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
