A security audit of the OpenSSL code sponsored by\nDARPA found several buffer overflows in OpenSSL which affect versions 0.9.7\nand 0.9.6d and earlier:\n1. The master key supplied by a client to an SSL version 2 server could be\noversized, causing a stack-based buffer overflow. This issue is remotely\nexploitable. Services that have SSLv2 disabled would not be vulnerable to\nthis issue. (CAN-2002-0656)\n2. The SSLv3 session ID supplied to a client from a malicious server could\nbe oversized and overrun a buffer. This issue looks to be remotely\nexploitable. (CAN-2002-0656)\n3. Various buffers used for storing ASCII representations of integers were\ntoo small on 64 bit platforms. This issue may be exploitable. (CAN-2002-0655)\nA further issue was found in OpenSSL 0.9.7 that does not affect versions of\nOpenSSL included in Stronghold (CAN-2002-0657).\nThe MM library provides an abstraction layer which allows related processes\nto easily share data. On systems where shared memory or other\ninter-process communication mechanisms are not available, the MM library\nwill emulate them using temporary files. MM is used in Stronghold to\nproviding shared memory pools to Apache modules.\nVersions of MM up to and including 1.1.3 open temporary files in an unsafe\nmanner, allowing a malicious local user to cause an application which uses\nMM to overwrite any file to which it has write access. (CAN-2002-0658)\nAll users are advised to upgrade to the new release which contains a\npatched version of MM that is not vulnerable to this issue.\nThe mod_ssl module provides strong cryptography for the Apache Web\nserver via the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security\n(TLS) protocols. Versions of mod_ssl prior to 2.8.10 are subject to a\nsingle NUL byte overflow that can cause arbitrary code execution.\n(CAN-2002-0653)\nIn order to exploit this vulnerability, the Apache Web server has to be\nconfigured to allow overriding of configuration settings on a per-directory\nbasis, and untrusted local users must be able to modify a directory in\nwhich the server is configured to allow overriding. The local attacker may\nthen become the user that Apache is running as (usually 'www' or 'nobody').\nThanks go to the OpenSSL team, Ben Laurie, and Marcus Meissner for\nproviding patches for these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
