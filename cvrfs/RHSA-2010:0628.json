A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,\nwhich gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in\nthe References section.","VDSM is a management module that serves as a Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Manager agent on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\nHypervisor or Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts.\nNote: This update has been tested and is supported on Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux 5.5 (with all appropriate post-GA 5.5-specific updates).\nA flaw was found in the way VDSM accepted SSL connections. An attacker\ncould trigger this flaw by creating a crafted SSL connection to VDSM,\npreventing VDSM from accepting SSL connections from other users.\n(CVE-2010-2811)\nThese updated vdsm22 packages also fix the following bugs:\n* suspend-to-file hibernation failed for huge guests due to the migration\nand hibernation constant values being too short for huge guests. This\nupdate makes the timeouts proportional to guest RAM size, thus allowing\nsuspension of huge guests in all cases except where storage is unbearably\nslow. (BZ#601275)\n* under certain circumstances, restarting a VDSM that was being used as a\nStorage Pool Manager killed all system processes on the host. With this\nupdate, stopping VDSM is ensured to kill only the processes that it\nstarted, and the VDSM SIGTERM handler is not run concurrently. With these\nchanges, all processes on the host are no longer killed when VDSM is\nrestarted. (BZ#614849)\n* when VDSM was requested to \"start in paused mode\", it incorrectly\nreported virtual guest state as \"WaitForLaunch\" instead of \"Paused\", which\nled to the virtual guest being inaccessible from Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Manager. With this update, VDSM reports such virtual guests\nas \"Paused\", and users are able to connect to the virtual guest display.\n(BZ#616464)\nRed Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 2.2 users with Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux hosts should install these updated packages, which resolve these\nissues. Alternatively, Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager can\ninstall the new package automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
