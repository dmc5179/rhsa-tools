The bug is specific\nto the Linux 2.4 kernel series. Aside from the fix, countless bugfixes\nhave been applied to this kernel as a result of code-audits by the\nMC project of the Stanford University and others.","A vulnerability in iptables \"RELATED\" connection tracking has been\ndiscovered. When using iptables to allow FTP \"RELATED\" connections\nthrough the firewall, carefully constructed PORT commands can open\narbitrary holes in the firewall.\nDefault installations of Red Hat Linux 7.1 are not vulnerable; however\nupgrading to this kernel is recommended regardless in order to benefit from\nthe other bug fixes in this kernel.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
