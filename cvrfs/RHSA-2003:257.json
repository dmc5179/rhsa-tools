This is\ndue to the fact that the redefined @_ variable is not reset between\nsuccessive calls. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-1323 to this issue.\nA cross-site scripting vulnerability was discovered in the start_form()\nfunction of CGI.pm. The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to insert a\nWeb script via a URL fed into the form's action parameter. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0615 to this issue.\nUsers of Perl are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain Perl 5.6.1 with backported security patches correcting these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
