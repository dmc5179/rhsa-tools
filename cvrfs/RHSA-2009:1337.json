A local attacker could use these flaws to overwrite an\narbitrary file writable by a victim running those utilities (typically\nroot) with the output of the utilities via a symbolic link attack.\n(CVE-2008-6552)\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n* gfs2_fsck now properly detects and repairs problems with sequence numbers\non GFS2 file systems.\n* GFS2 user utilities now use the file system UUID.\n* gfs2_grow now properly updates the file system size during operation.\n* gfs2_fsck now returns the proper exit codes.\n* gfs2_convert now properly frees blocks when removing free blocks up to\nheight 2.\n* the gfs2_fsck manual page has been renamed to fsck.gfs2 to match current\nstandards.\n* the 'gfs2_tool df' command now provides human-readable output.\n* mounting GFS2 file systems with the noatime or noquota option now works\nproperly.\n* new capabilities have been added to the gfs2_edit tool to help in testing\nand debugging GFS and GFS2 issues.\n* the 'gfs2_tool df' command no longer segfaults on file systems with a\nblock size other than 4k.\n* the gfs2_grow manual page no longer references the '-r' option, which has\nbeen removed.\n* the 'gfs2_tool unfreeze' command no longer hangs during use.\n* gfs2_convert no longer corrupts file systems when converting from GFS to\nGFS2.\n* gfs2_fsck no longer segfaults when encountering a block which is listed\nas both a data and stuffed directory inode.\n* gfs2_fsck can now fix file systems even if the journal is already locked\nfor use.\n* a GFS2 file system's metadata is now properly copied with 'gfs2_edit\nsavemeta' and 'gfs2_edit restoremeta'.\n* the gfs2_edit savemeta function now properly saves blocks of type 2.\n* 'gfs2_convert -vy' now works properly on the PowerPC architecture.\n* when mounting a GFS2 file system as '/', mount_gfs2 no longer fails after\nbeing unable to find the file system in '/proc/mounts'.\n* gfs2_fsck no longer segfaults when fixing 'EA leaf block type' problems.\nAll gfs2-utils users should upgrade to this updated package, which resolves\nthese issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
