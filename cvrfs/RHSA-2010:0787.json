A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\nbase score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the\nCVE link in the References section.","The glibc packages contain the standard C libraries used by multiple\nprograms on the system. These packages contain the standard C and the\nstandard math libraries. Without these two libraries, a Linux system cannot\nfunction properly.\nIt was discovered that the glibc dynamic linker/loader did not handle the\n$ORIGIN dynamic string token set in the LD_AUDIT environment variable\nsecurely. A local attacker with write access to a file system containing\nsetuid or setgid binaries could use this flaw to escalate their privileges.\n(CVE-2010-3847)\nRed Hat would like to thank Tavis Ormandy for reporting this issue.\nAll users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a\nbackported patch to correct this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
