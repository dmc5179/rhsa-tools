Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,\nwhich give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability\nfrom the CVE links in the References section.","Avahi is an implementation of the DNS Service Discovery and Multicast DNS\nspecifications for Zero Configuration Networking. It facilitates service\ndiscovery on a local network. Avahi and Avahi-aware applications allow you\nto plug your computer into a network and, with no configuration, view other\npeople to chat with, view printers to print to, and find shared files on\nother computers.\nA flaw was found in the way the Avahi daemon (avahi-daemon) processed\nMulticast DNS (mDNS) packets with corrupted checksums. An attacker on the\nlocal network could use this flaw to cause avahi-daemon on a target system\nto exit unexpectedly via specially-crafted mDNS packets. (CVE-2010-2244)\nA flaw was found in the way avahi-daemon processed incoming unicast mDNS\nmessages. If the mDNS reflector were enabled on a system, an attacker on\nthe local network could send a specially-crafted unicast mDNS message to\nthat system, resulting in its avahi-daemon flooding the network with a\nmulticast packet storm, and consuming a large amount of CPU. Note: The mDNS\nreflector is disabled by default. (CVE-2009-0758)\nAll users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues. After installing the update,\navahi-daemon will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
