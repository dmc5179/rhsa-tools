This can, under some\ncircumstances, lead to a compromise of the groups that LPRng runs as.\nSeveral scripts used the current process ID as\ntemporary file names and have now been altered to use the 'mktemp'\nprogram instead.\nAdditionally, an insecure invocation of the 'dvips' program has been\ndiscovered in the print filter used for handling DVI files. This has\nbeen corrected to use the -R option.\nThe temporary file handling flaw affects Red Hat Linux 7.1 and\nearlier.  The DVI print filter problem affects Red Hat Linux 7.0 and\nearlier.
