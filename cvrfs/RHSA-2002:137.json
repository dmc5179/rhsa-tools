The 'chfn'\nutility included in this package allows users to modify personal\ninformation stored in the system-wide password file, /etc/passwd. In order\nto modify this file, this application is installed setuid root.\nUnder certain conditions, a carefully crafted attack sequence can be\nperformed to exploit a complex file locking and modification race present\nin this utility allowing changes to be made to /etc/passwd.  \nIn order to successfully exploit the vulnerability and perform privilege\nescalation there is a need for a minimal administrator interaction. \nAdditionally, the password file must be over 4 kilobytes, and the local\nattackers entry must not be in the last 4 kilobytes of the password file.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0638 to this issue.\nAn interim workaround is to remove setuid flags from /usr/bin/chfn and\n/usr/bin/chsh.  All users of Red Hat Linux should update to the errata\nutil-linux packages which contain a patch to correct this vulnerability.\nMany thanks to Michal Zalewski of Bindview for alerting us to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
