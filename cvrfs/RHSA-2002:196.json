Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2002:196"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Moderate","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Xinetd contains a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.\nUPDATE 2002-12-02: Updated packages are available to fix issues encountered\nwith the previous errata packages.","Xinetd is a secure replacement for inetd, the Internet services daemon.\nVersions of Xinetd prior to 2.3.7 leak file descriptors for the signal\npipe to services that are launched by xinetd. This could allow an attacker\nto execute a DoS attack via the pipe. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project has assigned the name CAN-2002-0871 to this issue.\nRed Hat Linux 7.3 shipped with xinetd version 2.3.4 and is therefore\nvulnerable to this issue.  All users are advised to upgrade to the errata\npackages which fix the vulnerability.\nThanks to Solar Designer for discovering this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
