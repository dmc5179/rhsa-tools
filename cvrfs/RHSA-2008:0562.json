An attacker could use\nthese flaws to crash a Ruby application or, possibly, execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the Ruby application using untrusted inputs in\narray or string operations. (CVE-2008-2376, CVE-2008-2663, CVE-2008-2725,\nCVE-2008-2726)\nIt was discovered that Ruby used the alloca() memory allocation function in\nthe format (%) method of the String class without properly restricting\nmaximum string length. An attacker could use this flaw to crash a Ruby\napplication or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nRuby application using long, untrusted strings as format strings.\n(CVE-2008-2664)\nRed Hat would like to thank Drew Yao of the Apple Product Security team for\nreporting these issues.\nA flaw was discovered in the way Ruby's CGI module handles certain HTTP\nrequests. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted request and\ncause the Ruby CGI script to enter an infinite loop, possibly causing a\ndenial of service.
