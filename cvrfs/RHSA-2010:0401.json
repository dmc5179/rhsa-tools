TeX takes a text file and a set of\nformatting commands as input, and creates a typesetter-independent DeVice\nIndependent (DVI) file as output.\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the way teTeX processed virtual font\nfiles when converting DVI files into PostScript. An attacker could create a\nmalicious DVI file that would cause the dvips executable to crash or,\npotentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-0827)\nMultiple integer overflow flaws were found in the way teTeX processed\nspecial commands when converting DVI files into PostScript. An attacker\ncould create a malicious DVI file that would cause the dvips executable to\ncrash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-0739,\nCVE-2010-1440)\nA stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way teTeX processed DVI\nfiles containing HyperTeX references with long titles, when converting them\ninto PostScript. An attacker could create a malicious DVI file that would\ncause the dvips executable to crash. (CVE-2007-5935)\nteTeX embeds a copy of Xpdf, an open source Portable Document Format (PDF)\nfile viewer, to allow adding images in PDF format to the generated PDF\ndocuments. The following issues affect Xpdf code:\nMultiple integer overflow flaws were found in Xpdf. If a local user\ngenerated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing a specially-crafted\nPDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the user running pdflatex. (CVE-2009-0791,\nCVE-2009-3609)\nAll users of tetex are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
