A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\nbase score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the\nCVE link in the References section.","The glibc packages contain the standard C libraries used by multiple\nprograms on the system. These packages contain the standard C and the\nstandard math libraries. Without these two libraries, a Linux system cannot\nfunction properly.\nIt was discovered that the glibc dynamic linker/loader did not perform\nsufficient safety checks when loading dynamic shared objects (DSOs) to\nprovide callbacks for its auditing API during the execution of\nprivileged programs. A local attacker could use this flaw to escalate\ntheir privileges via a carefully-chosen system DSO library containing\nunsafe constructors. (CVE-2010-3856)\nRed Hat would like to thank Ben Hawkes and Tavis Ormandy for reporting this\nissue.\nAll users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a\nbackported patch to correct this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
