When\ndecoding base-64 data during HTTP basic authentication, an invalid base-64\ncharacter could cause a buffer overflow.  If the SWAT administration\nservice is enabled, this flaw could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary\ncode.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-0600 to this issue.\nAdditionally, the Samba team discovered a buffer overflow in the code used\nto support the 'mangling method = hash' smb.conf option.  Please be aware\nthat the default setting for this parameter is 'mangling method = hash2'\nand therefore not vulnerable.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0686 to this issue.\nThis release includes the updated upstream version 3.0.4 together with \nbackported security patches to correct these issues as well as a number of\npost-3.0.4 bug fixes from the Samba subversion repository.  \nThe most important bug fix allows Samba users to change their passwords \nif Microsoft patch KB 828741 (a critical update) had been applied. \nAll users of Samba should upgrade to these updated packages, which\nresolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
