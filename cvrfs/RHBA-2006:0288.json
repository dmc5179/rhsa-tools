The bind package provides a DNS server\n(named), which resolves host names to IP addresses, and tools for \ncontrol and verification of the DNS server. The bind-libs package\nprovides the libraries used by the DNS server and bind-utils. The\nbind-utils package provides DNS lookup utilities: host(1), dig(1),\nand nslookup. The bind-devel package provides header files for \ndevelopment with the BIND libraries. A default set of DNS server\nconfiguration files is provided by the caching-nameserver package.\nThis update delivers backports from ISC BIND 9.2.6 to apply these fixes:\n- If a lookup for another name server's addresses returned addresses \nthat were unreachable via local routers, lookups for names in domains\nfor which that server is authoritative could experience a four second\ndelay per name not in the cache. No delay is now incurred for addresses\nserved by servers with unreachable addresses.\n- Fixes to named's thread locking logic: This feature in ISC BIND 9.3.0+\nwas backported and delivered in this update.\n- edns-udp-size: Users can now set the maximum size of UDP packets used \nfor EDNS0 (RFC 2671), to get past routers / firewalls that enforce a\nmaximum UDP packet size.\nMiscellaneous bug fixes, including improved support for custom named.conf\nlocations, are also delivered in this update.\nAll BIND users are advised to upgrade to the updated bind packages.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
