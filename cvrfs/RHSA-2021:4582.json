STF then transmits the information to a centralized, receiving Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) deployment for storage, retrieval, and monitoring.\nSecurity fixes:\n* golang: crypto/tls: certificate of wrong type is causing TLS client to panic (CVE-2021-34558)\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\nBug fixes:\n* STF 1.3.3 now supports OpenShift Container Platform 4.8 as an installation platform. (BZ#2013268)\n* With this update, the servicetelemetrys.infra.watch CRD has a validation that limits the clouds[].name to 10 characters and alphanumeric to avoid issues with extra characters in the cloud name and names being too long. (BZ#2011603)\n* Previously, when you installed STF without having Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK) Operator installed, the following error message was returned: \"Failed to find exact match for elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/v1beta1.Elasticsearch\". The error was as a result of Service Telemetry Operator trying to look up information from a non-existent API interface.\nWith this update, the Service Telemetry Operator verifies that the API exists before it attempts to make requests to the API interface that is provided by ECK.
