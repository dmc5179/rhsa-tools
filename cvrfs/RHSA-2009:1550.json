This could,\npotentially, lead to a denial of service issue. (CVE-2008-5029, Important)\n* the sendmsg() function in the Linux kernel did not block during UNIX\nsocket garbage collection. This could, potentially, lead to a local denial\nof service. (CVE-2008-5300, Important)\n* the exit_notify() function in the Linux kernel did not properly reset the\nexit signal if a process executed a set user ID (setuid) application before\nexiting. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to elevate their\nprivileges. (CVE-2009-1337, Important)\n* a flaw was found in the Intel PRO/1000 network driver in the Linux\nkernel. Frames with sizes near the MTU of an interface may be split across\nmultiple hardware receive descriptors. Receipt of such a frame could leak\nthrough a validation check, leading to a corruption of the length check. A\nremote attacker could use this flaw to send a specially-crafted packet that\nwould cause a denial of service or code execution. (CVE-2009-1385,\nImportant)\n* the ADDR_COMPAT_LAYOUT and MMAP_PAGE_ZERO flags were not cleared when a\nsetuid or setgid program was executed. A local, unprivileged user could use\nthis flaw to bypass the mmap_min_addr protection mechanism and perform a\nNULL pointer dereference attack, or bypass the Address Space Layout\nRandomization (ASLR) security feature. (CVE-2009-1895, Important)\n* it was discovered that, when executing a new process, the clear_child_tid\npointer in the Linux kernel is not cleared. If this pointer points to a\nwritable portion of the memory of the new program, the kernel could corrupt\nfour bytes of memory, possibly leading to a local denial of service or\nprivilege escalation. (CVE-2009-2848, Important)\n* missing initialization flaws were found in getname() implementations in\nthe IrDA sockets, AppleTalk DDP protocol, NET/ROM protocol, and ROSE\nprotocol implementations in the Linux kernel. Certain data structures in\nthese getname() implementations were not initialized properly before being\ncopied to user-space. These flaws could lead to an information leak.\n(CVE-2009-3002, Important)\n* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in each of the following\nfunctions in the Linux kernel: pipe_read_open(), pipe_write_open(), and\npipe_rdwr_open(). When the mutex lock is not held, the i_pipe pointer could\nbe released by other processes before it is used to update the pipe's\nreader and writer counters. This could lead to a local denial of service or\nprivilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3547, Important)\nBug fixes:\n* this update adds the mmap_min_addr tunable and restriction checks to help\nprevent unprivileged users from creating new memory mappings below the\nminimum address. This can help prevent the exploitation of NULL pointer\ndereference bugs. Note that mmap_min_addr is set to zero (disabled) by\ndefault for backwards compatibility. (BZ#512642)\n* a bridge reference count problem in IPv6 has been fixed. (BZ#457010)\n* enforce null-termination of user-supplied arguments to setsockopt().\n(BZ#505514)\n* the gcc flag \"-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks\" was added to the kernel\nbuild options. This prevents gcc from optimizing out NULL pointer checks\nafter the first use of a pointer. NULL pointer bugs are often exploited by\nattackers. Keeping these checks is a safety measure. (BZ#511185)\n* a check has been added to the IPv4 code to make sure that rt is not NULL,\nto help prevent future bugs in functions that call ip_append_data() from\nbeing exploitable. (BZ#520300)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
