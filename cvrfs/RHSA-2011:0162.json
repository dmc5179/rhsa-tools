A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw\nto cause a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4242, Moderate)\n* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collector for AF_UNIX\nsockets. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to trigger a\ndenial of service (out-of-memory condition). (CVE-2010-4249, Moderate)\n* Missing initialization flaws were found in the Linux kernel. A local,\nunprivileged user could use these flaws to cause information leaks.\n(CVE-2010-3876, CVE-2010-4072, CVE-2010-4073, CVE-2010-4075, CVE-2010-4080,\nCVE-2010-4083, CVE-2010-4158, Low)\nRed Hat would like to thank Alan Cox for reporting CVE-2010-4242; Vegard\nNossum for reporting CVE-2010-4249; Vasiliy Kulikov for reporting\nCVE-2010-3876; Kees Cook for reporting CVE-2010-4072; and Dan Rosenberg for\nreporting CVE-2010-4073, CVE-2010-4075, CVE-2010-4080, CVE-2010-4083, and\nCVE-2010-4158.\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel where, if used in conjunction with\nanother flaw that can result in a kernel Oops, could possibly lead to\nprivilege escalation. It does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 as the\nsysctl panic_on_oops variable is turned on by default. However, as a\npreventive measure if the variable is turned off by an administrator, this\nupdate addresses the issue. Red Hat would like to thank Nelson Elhage for\nreporting this vulnerability. (BZ#659568)\n* On Intel I/O Controller Hub 9 (ICH9) hardware, jumbo frame support is\nachieved by using page-based sk_buff buffers without any packet split. The\nentire frame data is copied to the page(s) rather than some to the\nskb->data area and some to the page(s) when performing a typical\npacket-split. This caused problems with the filtering code and frames were\ngetting dropped before they were received by listening applications. This\nbug could eventually lead to the IP address being released and not being\nable to be re-acquired from DHCP if the MTU (Maximum Transfer Unit) was\nchanged (for an affected interface using the e1000e driver). With this\nupdate, frames are no longer dropped and an IP address is correctly\nre-acquired after a previous release. (BZ#664667)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
