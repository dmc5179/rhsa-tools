Version 2.2.5 of glibc and earlier versions are\naffected.  A system would be vulnerable to this issue if the\n\"networks\" database in /etc/nsswitch.conf includes the \"dns\" entry.  By\ndefault, Red Hat Linux ships with \"networks\" set to \"files\" and\nis therefore not vulnerable to this issue.  (CAN-2002-0684)\nA second, related, issue is a bug in the glibc-compat packages,  which\nprovide compatibility for applications compiled against glibc version\n2.0.x.  Applications compiled against this version (such as those\ndistributed with early Red Hat Linux releases 5.0, 5.1, and 5.2) could also\nbe vulnerable to this issue.  (CAN-2002-0651)\nThese errata packages for Red Hat Linux 7.1 and 7.2 on the Itanium\narchitecture also include a fix for the strncpy implementation in some\nboundary cases.\nAll users should upgrade to these errata packages which contain patches to\nthe glibc and glibc-compat libraries and therefore are not vulnerable to\nthese issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
