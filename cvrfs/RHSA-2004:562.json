If a\nparticular location context has been configured to require a specific set\nof cipher suites, then a client will be able to access that location using\nany cipher suite allowed by the virtual host configuration.   The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0885 to this issue.\nAn issue has been discovered in the handling of white space in request\nheader lines using MIME folding.  A malicious client could send a carefully\ncrafted request, forcing the server to consume large amounts of memory,\nleading to a denial of service.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0942 to this issue.\nSeveral minor bugs were also discovered, including:\n- In the mod_cgi module, problems that arise when CGI scripts are \ninvoked from SSI pages by mod_include using the \"#include virtual\" \nsyntax have been fixed.\n- In the mod_dav_fs module, problems with the handling of indirect locks\non the S/390x platform have been fixed.\nUsers of the Apache HTTP server who are affected by these issues should\nupgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported patches.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
