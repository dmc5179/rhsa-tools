A remote attacker could use this flaw to force\na proxy process to consume large amounts of CPU time. (CVE-2009-1890)\nA flaw was found in the handling of the \"Options\" and \"AllowOverride\"\ndirectives used by the Apache HTTP Server. In configurations using the\n\"AllowOverride\" directive with certain \"Options=\" arguments, local users\nwere not restricted from executing commands from a Server-Side-Include\nscript as intended. (CVE-2009-1195)\nA denial of service flaw was found in the Apache mod_deflate module. This\nmodule continued to compress large files until compression was complete,\neven if the network connection that requested the content was closed before\ncompression completed. This would cause mod_deflate to consume large\namounts of CPU if mod_deflate was enabled for a large file. (CVE-2009-1891)\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.0 should upgrade to these\nupdated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.\nAfter installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted\nfor the update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
