The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-0176 to this issue.\nJonathan Heussser discovered that a carefully-crafted RADIUS packet could\ncause a crash.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0365 to this issue.\nEthereal 0.8.13 to 0.10.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of\nservice (crash) via a zero-length Presentation protocol selector.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2004-0367 to this issue.\nUsers of Ethereal should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\na version of Ethereal that is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
