This could be\nmisused by a malicious website to read and write local files or execute\nlocal applications in the context of the user running the Java process.\n(CVE-2008-0657) \nA flaw was found in the Java XSLT processing classes. An untrusted\napplication or applet could cause a denial of service, or execute arbitrary\ncode with the permissions of the user running the JRE. (CVE-2008-1187) \nSeveral buffer overflow flaws were found in Java Web Start (JWS). An\nuntrusted JNLP application could access local files or execute local\napplications accessible to the user running the JRE.\n(CVE-2008-1188, CVE-2008-1189, CVE-2008-1190, CVE-2008-1196) \nA flaw was found in the Java Plug-in. A remote attacker could bypass the\nsame origin policy, executing arbitrary code with the permissions of the\nuser running the JRE. (CVE-2008-1192) \nA flaw was found in the JRE image parsing libraries. An untrusted\napplication or applet could cause a denial of service, or possible execute\narbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the JRE.\n(CVE-2008-1193)\nA flaw was found in the JRE color management library. An untrusted\napplication or applet could trigger a denial of service (JVM crash).\n(CVE-2008-1194)\nThe JRE allowed untrusted JavaScript code to create local network\nconnections by the use of Java APIs. A remote attacker could use these\nflaws to acesss local network services. (CVE-2008-1195) \nAll users of java-ibm-1.5.0 are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, that contain IBM's 1.5.0 SR7 Java release which resolves these\nissues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
