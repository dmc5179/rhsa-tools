IPsec uses strong cryptography to provide\nboth authentication and encryption services. These services allow you to\nbuild secure tunnels through untrusted networks. Everything passing through\nthe untrusted network is encrypted by the IPsec gateway machine, and\ndecrypted by the gateway at the other end of the tunnel. The resulting\ntunnel is a virtual private network (VPN).\nGerd v. Egidy discovered a flaw in the Dead Peer Detection (DPD) in\nOpenswan's pluto IKE daemon. A remote attacker could use a malicious DPD\npacket to crash the pluto daemon. (CVE-2009-0790)\nIt was discovered that Openswan's livetest script created temporary files\nin an insecure manner. A local attacker could use this flaw to overwrite\narbitrary files owned by the user running the script. (CVE-2008-4190)\nNote: The livetest script is an incomplete feature and was not\nautomatically executed by any other script distributed with Openswan, or\nintended to be used at all, as was documented in its man page. In these\nupdated packages, the script only prints an informative message and exits\nimmediately when run.\nAll users of openswan are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing\nthis update, the ipsec service will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
