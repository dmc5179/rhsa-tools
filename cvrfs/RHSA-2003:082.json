A number of issues have been found in\nversions of these projects:\nIn a paper, Brice Canvel, Alain Hiltgen, Serge Vaudenay, and Martin\nVuagnoux describe and demonstrate a timing-based attack on CBC ciphersuites\nin SSL and TLS. An active attacker may be able to use timing observations\nto distinguish between two different error cases: cipher padding errors and\nMAC verification errors. Over multiple connections this can leak\nsufficient information to be able to retrieve the plain text of a common,\nfixed block. In order for an attack to be successful an attacker must be\nable to act as a man-in-the-middle to intercept and modify multiple\nconnections which all involve a common fixed plain text block (such as a\npassword), and have good network conditions that allow small changes in\ntiming to be reliably observed.\nThe Apache Web server does not prevent escape sequences from being written\nto the error log. This could allow an attacker to embed arbitrary escape\nsequences into the log file. A recent paper by HD Moore highlighted\nseveral issues where common terminal emulator software (such as xterm) can\nbe remotely abused or exploited by displaying arbitrary escape sequences.\nThe MySQL client library (libmysqlclient) used in the PHP MySQL extension\nin PHP versions earlier than 4.3.0 does not properly verify length fields\nfor certain responses in the read_rows or read_one_row routines, which\nallows a malicious server to cause a denial of service and possibly execute\narbitrary code.\nA source code exposure vulnerability has been found that affects Tomcat\nversions 4.0.0 through 4.0.5 and 4.1.0 through 4.1.12, in a variant of\nthe issue addressed in RHSA-2002:217. Using a carefully crafted request, a\nremote attacker can read the source code of any deployed JSP file.\nIn addition to the security fixes, two bug fixes have also been applied:\nIf Apache is configured to act as a reverse proxy by specifying the backend\nserver using a numeric IP address, the mod_proxy module will perform a\nredundant reverse DNS lookup on the IP address, causing a delay in request\nprocessing.\nA bug in mod_authz_ldap version 0.21 and earlier prevent\nauthentication being performed by other Apache modules (such as\nfiled-based authentication using mod_auth) when the mod_authz_ldap module\nis loaded.\nStronghold 4 cross platform contains OpenSSL 0.9.6c, Apache 1.3.22, PHP\n4.1.2, Tomcat 4.0.5, and mod_authz_ldap 0.19, and is therefore vulnerable\nto these issues. Users of Stronghold are advised to update to the errata\nversions of Stronghold 4 which contain backported security fixes and are\nnot vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
