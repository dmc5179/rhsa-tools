This is the ninth\nregular update.\nThis security advisory has been rated as having important security impact\nby the Red Hat Security Response Team.","The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.\nThis is the ninth regular kernel update to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.\nThere were no new features introduced by this update.  The only changes\nthat have been included address critical customer needs or security\nissues (elaborated below).\nKey areas affected by fixes in this update include the networking\nsubsystem, dcache handling, the ext2 and ext3 file systems, the USB\nsubsystem, ACPI handling, and the audit subsystem.  There were also\nseveral isolated fixes in the tg3, e1000, megaraid_sas, and aacraid\ndevice drivers.\nThe following security bugs were fixed in this update:\n* a flaw in the cramfs file system that allowed invalid compressed\ndata to cause memory corruption (CVE-2006-5823, low)\n* a flaw in the ext2 file system that allowed an invalid inode size\nto cause a denial of service (system hang)  (CVE-2006-6054, low)\n* a flaw in IPV6 flow label handling that allowed a local user to\ncause a denial of service (crash)  (CVE-2007-1592, important)\nNote: The kernel-unsupported package contains various drivers and modules\nthat are unsupported and therefore might contain security problems that\nhave not been addressed.\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 users are advised to upgrade their\nkernels to the packages associated with their machine architectures\nand configurations as listed in this erratum.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
