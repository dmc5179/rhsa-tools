It is possible that Squid can leak Set-Cookie header\ninformation to other clients connecting to Squid. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2005-0626 to this issue. Please note that this issue only affected Red\nHat Enterprise Linux 4. \nA bug was found in the way Squid handles PUT and POST requests. It is\npossible for an authorised remote user to cause a failed PUT or POST\nrequest which can cause Squid to crash. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0718 to\nthis issue.\nA bug was found in the way Squid processes errors in the access control\nlist. It is possible that an error in the access control list could give\nusers more access than intended. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-1345 to this issue.\nA bug was found in the way Squid handles access to the cachemgr.cgi script. \nIt is possible for an authorised remote user to bypass access control\nlists with this flaw. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-1999-0710 to this issue.\nA bug was found in the way Squid handles DNS replies.  If the port Squid\nuses for DNS requests is not protected by a firewall it is possible for a\nremote attacker to spoof DNS replies, possibly redirecting a user to\nspoofed or malicious content. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-1519 to this issue. \nAdditionally this update fixes the following bugs:   \n- LDAP Authentication fails with an assertion error when using Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 4 \nUsers of Squid should upgrade to this updated package, which contains\nbackported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
