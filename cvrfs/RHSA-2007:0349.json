A\nPHP script which implements an XML-RPC server using this extension could\nallow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code as the 'apache' user.\nNote that this flaw does not affect PHP applications using the pure-PHP\nXML_RPC class provided in /usr/share/pear. (CVE-2007-1864)\nA flaw was found in the PHP 'ftp' extension. If a PHP script used this\nextension to provide access to a private FTP server, and passed untrusted\nscript input directly to any function provided by this extension, a remote\nattacker would be able to send arbitrary FTP commands to the server.\n(CVE-2007-2509)\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
