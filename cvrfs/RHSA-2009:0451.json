If a signal interrupted a lock\nrequest, the local POSIX lock was incorrectly created. This could cause a\ndenial of service on the NFS server if a file descriptor was closed before\nits corresponding lock request returned. (CVE-2008-4307, Important)\n* a deficiency was found in the Linux kernel system call auditing\nimplementation on 64-bit systems. This could allow a local, unprivileged\nuser to circumvent a system call audit configuration, if that configuration\nfiltered based on the \"syscall\" number or arguments.\n(CVE-2009-0834, Important)\n* Chris Evans reported a deficiency in the Linux kernel secure-computing\nimplementation on 64-bit systems. This could allow a local, unprivileged\nuser to bypass intended access restrictions, if those access restriction\nfilters were based on the \"syscall\" number or arguments.\n(CVE-2009-0835, Important)\n* the exit_notify() function in the Linux kernel did not properly reset the\nexit signal if a process executed a set user ID (setuid) application before\nexiting. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to elevate their\nprivileges. (CVE-2009-1337, Important)\n* Chris Evans reported a deficiency in the Linux kernel signals\nimplementation. The clone() system call permits the caller to indicate the\nsignal it wants to receive when its child exits. When clone() is called\nwith the CLONE_PARENT flag, it permits the caller to clone a new child that\nshares the same parent as itself, enabling the indicated signal to be sent\nto the caller's parent (instead of the caller), even if the caller's parent\nhas different real and effective user IDs. This could lead to a denial of\nservice of the parent. (CVE-2009-0028, Moderate)\n* an off-by-two error was found in the set_selection() function of the\nLinux kernel. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to cause a denial\nof service when making a selection of characters in a UTF-8 console. Note:\nphysical console access is required to exploit this issue.\n(CVE-2009-1046, Low)\nThese updated packages also fix the following bug:\n* the __scsi_device_lookup_by_target() function was always returning the\nfirst matching device, regardless of the state of the device. This meant\nthat any valid device listed after a deleted device would not be found. The\n__scsi_device_lookup_by_target() function was modified so that deleted\ndevices are skipped, and valid devices are now found. (BZ#495976)\nAll Red Hat Enterprise MRG users should install this update, which resolves\nthese issues. For this update to take effect, the system must be rebooted.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
