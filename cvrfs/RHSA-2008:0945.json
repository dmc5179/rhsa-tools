A malicious SWF file could populate the clipboard with a URL\nthat could cause the user to mistakenly load an attacker-controlled URL.\n(CVE-2008-3873)\nA flaw was found which allowed Adobe Flash Player's ActionScript to\ninitiate file uploads and downloads without user interaction.\nFileReference.browse and FileReference.download calls can now only be\ninitiated via user interaction, such as mouse-clicks or key-presses on the\nkeyboard. (CVE-2008-4401)\nA flaw was found in Adobe Flash Player's display of the Settings Manager\ncontent. A malicious SWF file could trick the user into unknowingly\nclicking a link or dialog. This could then give the malicious SWF file\npermission to access the local machine's camera or microphone.\n(CVE-2008-4503)\nFlaws were found in the way Flash Player restricted the interpretation and\nusage of cross-domain policy files.  A remote attacker could use Flash\nPlayer to conduct cross-domain and cross-site scripting attacks\n(CVE-2007-4324, CVE-2007-6243). This update provides enhanced fixes for\nthese issues.\nAdobe Flash Player 10 also includes bug fixes and feature enhancements\nincluding:\n* improved stability on the Linux platform by fixing a race condition issue\nin sound output.\n* new support for custom filters and effects, native 3D transformation and\nanimation, advanced audio processing, a new, more flexible text engine, and\nGPU hardware acceleration. \nFor more information on new features and enhancements, see the Adobe Flash\nPlayer site and the Adobe Labs Release Notes.\nNote: some users may have installed a 3rd-party component, libflashsupport,\nfor older versions of Flash Player. Adobe Flash Player 10 no longer\nsupports libflashsupport. Users are advised to remove libflashsupport if\nthey have it installed.\nAll users of Adobe Flash Player should upgrade to this updated package,\nwhich contains Flash Player version 10.0.12.36.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
