Many\npeople find this to be an easier way to apply updates. To use Red Hat\nNetwork, launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nNote that you must select kernel-utils explicitly on default configurations\nof up2date.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003:056"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["An updated kernel-utils package is available that removes the setuid bits\nincorrectly assigned to the uml_net binary.","The kernel-utils package contains several utilities that can be used to\ncontrol the kernel or machine hardware.\nThe  uml_net utility, a user mode linux (UML) utility, in the kernel-utils\npackages that shipped with Red Hat Linux 8.0 incorrectly sets its uid to\nthe root user. This could allow local users to control certain network\ninterfaces, add and remove arp entries and routes, and put interfaces in\nand out of promiscuous mode.\nAll users of the kernel-utils package should update to these errata\npackages which contain a version of uml_net which does not setuid root.  \nAlternatively, as a work-around to this vulnerability, an administrator can\nissue the following command as root:\nchmod -s /usr/bin/uml_net\nRed Hat would like to thank Johnny Robertson for alerting us to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
