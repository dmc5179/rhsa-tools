This update contains bug fixes of upstream\nsquirrelmail 1.4.6 with some additional improvements to international\nlanguage support.\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.","SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP4.\nA bug was found in the way SquirrelMail presents the right frame to the\nuser. If a user can be tricked into opening a carefully crafted URL, it is\npossible to present the user with arbitrary HTML data. (CVE-2006-0188)\nA bug was found in the way SquirrelMail filters incoming HTML email. It is\npossible to cause a victim's web browser to request remote content by\nopening a HTML email while running a web browser that processes certain\ntypes of invalid style sheets. Only Internet Explorer is known to process\nsuch malformed style sheets. (CVE-2006-0195)\nA bug was found in the way SquirrelMail processes a request to select an\nIMAP mailbox. If a user can be tricked into opening a carefully crafted\nURL, it is possible to execute arbitrary IMAP commands as the user viewing\ntheir mail with SquirrelMail. (CVE-2006-0377)\nUsers of SquirrelMail are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains SquirrelMail version 1.4.6 and is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
