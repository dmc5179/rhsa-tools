Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.","The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n* a deficiency was found in the fasync_helper() implementation. This could\nallow a local, unprivileged user to leverage a use-after-free of locked,\nasynchronous file descriptors to cause a denial of service or privilege\nescalation. (CVE-2009-4141, Important)\n* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the sctp_rcv_ootb() function\nin the Linux kernel Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)\nimplementation. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted SCTP\npacket to a target system, resulting in a denial of service.\n(CVE-2010-0008, Important)\n* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the ip6_dst_lookup_tail()\nfunction in the Linux kernel. An attacker on the local network could\ntrigger this flaw by sending IPv6 traffic to a target system, leading to a\nsystem crash (kernel OOPS) if dst->neighbour is NULL on the target system\nwhen receiving an IPv6 packet. (CVE-2010-0437, Important)\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n* programs compiled on x86, and that also call sched_rr_get_interval(),\nwere silently corrupted when run on 64-bit systems. With this update, when\nsuch programs attempt to call sched_rr_get_interval() on 64-bit systems,\nsys32_sched_rr_get_interval() is called instead, which resolves this issue.\n(BZ#557683)\n* the fix for CVE-2009-4538 provided by RHSA-2010:0053 introduced a\nregression, preventing Wake on LAN (WoL) working for network devices using\nthe Intel PRO/1000 Linux driver, e1000e. Attempting to configure WoL for\nsuch devices resulted in the following error, even when configuring valid\noptions:\n\"Cannot set new wake-on-lan settings: Operation not supported\nnot setting wol\"\nThis update resolves this regression, and WoL now works as expected for\nnetwork devices using the e1000e driver. (BZ#559334)\n* a number of bugs have been fixed in the copy_user routines for Intel 64\nand AMD64 systems, one of which could have possibly led to data corruption.\n(BZ#568307)\n* on some systems, a race condition in the inode-based file event\nnotifications implementation caused soft lockups and the following\nmessages:\n\"BUG: warning at fs/inotify.c:181/set_dentry_child_flags()\"\n\"BUG: soft lockup - CPU#[x] stuck for 10s!\"\nThis update resolves this race condition, and also removes the inotify\ndebugging code from the kernel, due to race conditions in that code.\n(BZ#568663)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
