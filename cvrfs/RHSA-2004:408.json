In order to exploit this issue, a user who is authorized to use\nApache as a proxy would have to attempt to connect to a carefully crafted\nhostname via SSL.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0700 to this issue.\nUsers of mod_ssl should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a\nbackported patch to correct this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
