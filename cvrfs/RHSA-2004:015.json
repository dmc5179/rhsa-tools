Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains\nthe desired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of\nup2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be\ndownloaded directly from the RHN website:\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2004:015"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Low","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated httpd packages that fix two minor security issues in the Apache Web\nserver are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.","The Apache HTTP Server is a powerful, full-featured, efficient, and\nfreely-available Web server.\nAn issue in the handling of regular expressions from configuration files\nwas discovered in releases of the Apache HTTP Server version 2.0 prior to\n2.0.48. To exploit this issue an attacker would need to have the ability\nto write to Apache configuration files such as .htaccess or httpd.conf. A\ncarefully-crafted configuration file can cause an exploitable buffer\noverflow and would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the\ncontext of the server (in default configurations as the 'apache' user).\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2003-0542 to this issue.\nUsers of the Apache HTTP Server should upgrade to these erratum packages,\nwhich contain backported patches correcting these issues, and are applied\nto Apache version 2.0.46.  This update also includes fixes for a number of\nminor bugs found in this version of the Apache HTTP Server.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
