An attacker could create a mail message containing a\nspecially-crafted PNG image that, when opened, could cause Thunderbird to\ncrash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nuser running Thunderbird. (CVE-2010-1205)\nSeveral flaws were found in the processing of malformed HTML mail content.\nAn HTML mail message containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird\nto crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nuser running Thunderbird. (CVE-2010-0174, CVE-2010-1200, CVE-2010-1211,\nCVE-2010-1214, CVE-2010-2753)\nAn integer overflow flaw was found in the processing of malformed HTML mail\ncontent. An HTML mail message containing malicious content could cause\nThunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2010-1199)\nSeveral use-after-free flaws were found in Thunderbird. Viewing an HTML\nmail message containing malicious content could result in Thunderbird\nexecuting arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\nThunderbird. (CVE-2010-0175, CVE-2010-0176, CVE-2010-0177)\nA flaw was found in the way Thunderbird plug-ins interact. It was possible\nfor a plug-in to reference the freed memory from a different plug-in,\nresulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nuser running Thunderbird. (CVE-2010-1198)\nA flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled the \"Content-Disposition:\nattachment\" HTTP header when the \"Content-Type: multipart\" HTTP header was\nalso present. Loading remote HTTP content that allows arbitrary uploads and\nrelies on the \"Content-Disposition: attachment\" HTTP header to prevent\ncontent from being displayed inline, could be used by an attacker to serve\nmalicious content to users. (CVE-2010-1197)\nA same-origin policy bypass flaw was found in Thunderbird. Remote HTML\ncontent could steal private data from different remote HTML content\nThunderbird has loaded. (CVE-2010-2754)\nAll Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which\nresolves these issues. All running instances of Thunderbird must be\nrestarted for the update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
