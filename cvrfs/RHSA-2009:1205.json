The httpd package shipped\nwith Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 contains embedded copies of the Apache\nPortable Runtime (APR) libraries, which provide a free library of C data\nstructures and routines, and also additional utility interfaces to support\nXML parsing, LDAP, database interfaces, URI parsing, and more.\nMultiple integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows,\nwere found in the way the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) manages memory pool\nand relocatable memory allocations. An attacker could use these flaws to\nissue a specially-crafted request for memory allocation, which would lead\nto a denial of service (application crash) or, potentially, execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of an application using the APR\nlibraries. (CVE-2009-2412)\nA denial of service flaw was found in the Apache mod_deflate module. This\nmodule continued to compress large files until compression was complete,\neven if the network connection that requested the content was closed\nbefore compression completed. This would cause mod_deflate to consume\nlarge amounts of CPU if mod_deflate was enabled for a large file.\n(CVE-2009-1891)\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n* in some cases the Content-Length header was dropped from HEAD responses.\nThis resulted in certain sites not working correctly with mod_proxy, such\nas www.windowsupdate.com. (BZ#506016)\nAll httpd users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues. After installing the updated\npackages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
