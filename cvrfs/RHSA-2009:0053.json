A\nlocal, unprivileged user could use the flaw to listen on the same socket\nmore than once, possibly causing a denial of service. (CVE-2008-5079,\nImportant)\n* a buffer overflow flaw was found in the libertas driver. This could,\npotentially, lead to a remote denial of service when an invalid beacon or\nprobe response was received. (CVE-2008-5134, Important)\n* a race condition was found in the Linux kernel \"inotify\" watch removal\nand umount implementation. This could allow a local, unprivileged user  \nto cause a privilege escalation or a denial of service. (CVE-2008-5182,  \nImportant)\n* the sendmsg() function in the Linux kernel did not block during UNIX\nsocket garbage collection. This could, potentially, lead to a local denial\nof service. (CVE-2008-5300, Important)\n* a buffer overflow was found in the Linux kernel Partial Reliable Stream\nControl Transmission Protocol (PR-SCTP) implementation. This could,\npotentially, lead to a denial of service if a Forward-TSN chunk is received\nwith a large stream ID. (CVE-2009-0065, Important)\n* a deficiency was found in the libATA implementation. This could,\npotentially, lead to a denial of service. By default, the \"/dev/sg*\"\ndevices are accessible only to the root user. (CVE-2008-5700, Low)\nThese updated packages also address numerous bugs, including the following:\n* a race condition caused the timer to stop responding. This was fixed by\ncorrecting the behavior of the alloc_posix_timer() function. \n* the kernel was behaving differently for varying file capabilities. This\nwas resolved by ensuring the get_file_caps() function was preceded by\nclearing bprm->caps_*.\n* a check was included on the limit of the shadow.bytes array, to prevent\nvalue outside the limits being written and over riding other data areas.\n* the kernel-rt-2.6.24.7-81.el5rt kernel displayed a warning on boot\nstating that the hwclock failed. This was due to a compatibility problem\nwith the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 file system. It was resolved by adding\na new udev rule that ensured /dev was set up correctly.\n* the GPS clock daemon was becoming unstable due to a problem in adjtimex.\nThe issue was located and corrected.\n* the events_trace tracer was providing bad parameters to syscalls on i386\nmachines. This was due to the sys_call interface needing to use the\nassembly linked annotation and the edx register being used before it was\nstored on the stack. Both these issues were corrected.\nAll Red Hat Enterprise MRG users should install this update which addresses\nthese vulnerabilities and fixes these bugs. For this update to take effect,\nthe system must be rebooted.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
