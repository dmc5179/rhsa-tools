To exploit this vulnerability a local\nattacker would need to be able to get a victim to run man on a carefully\ncrafted man file, and for the attacker to be able to create a file called\n\"unsafe\" that will be on the victim's default path.\nUsers of man can upgrade to these erratum packages which contain a patch to\ncorrect this vulnerability.  These erratum packages also contain fixes for\na number of other bugs.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
