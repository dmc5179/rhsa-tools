If the Itip Formatter plug-in was disabled and a user opened a mail\nwith a carefully crafted iCalendar attachment, arbitrary code could be\nexecuted as the user running Evolution. (CVE-2008-1108)\nNote: the Itip Formatter plug-in, which allows calendar information\n(attachments with a MIME type of \"text/calendar\") to be displayed as part\nof the e-mail message, is enabled by default.\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Evolution parsed\niCalendar attachments with an overly long \"DESCRIPTION\" property string. If\na user responded to a carefully crafted iCalendar attachment in a\nparticular way, arbitrary code could be executed as the user running\nEvolution. (CVE-2008-1109).\nThe particular response required to trigger this vulnerability was as\nfollows:\n1. Receive the carefully crafted iCalendar attachment.\n2. Accept the associated meeting.\n3. Open the calender the meeting was in.\n4. Reply to the sender.\nRed Hat would like to thank Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research for\nresponsibly disclosing these issues.\nAll Evolution users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches which resolves these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
