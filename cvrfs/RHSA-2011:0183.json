Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.","OpenOffice.org is an office productivity suite that includes desktop\napplications, such as a word processor, spreadsheet application,\npresentation manager, formula editor, and a drawing program.\nAn array index error and an integer signedness error were found in the way\nOpenOffice.org parsed certain Rich Text Format (RTF) files. An attacker\ncould use these flaws to create a specially-crafted RTF file that, when\nopened, would cause OpenOffice.org to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the user running OpenOffice.org.\n(CVE-2010-3451, CVE-2010-3452)\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw and an array index error were found in\nthe way OpenOffice.org parsed certain Microsoft Office Word documents. An\nattacker could use these flaws to create a specially-crafted Microsoft\nOffice Word document that, when opened, would cause OpenOffice.org to crash\nor, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user\nrunning OpenOffice.org. (CVE-2010-3453, CVE-2010-3454)\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way OpenOffice.org\nparsed certain Microsoft Office PowerPoint files. An attacker could use\nthis flaw to create a specially-crafted Microsoft Office PowerPoint file\nthat, when opened, would cause OpenOffice.org to crash or, possibly,\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\nOpenOffice.org. (CVE-2010-4253)\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way OpenOffice.org\nparsed certain TARGA (Truevision TGA) files. An attacker could use this\nflaw to create a specially-crafted TARGA file. If a document containing\nthis specially-crafted TARGA file was opened, or if a user tried to insert\nthe file into an existing document, it would cause OpenOffice.org to crash\nor, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user\nrunning OpenOffice.org. (CVE-2010-4643)\nA directory traversal flaw was found in the way OpenOffice.org handled the\ninstallation of XSLT filter descriptions packaged in Java Archive (JAR)\nfiles, as well as the installation of OpenOffice.org Extension (.oxt)\nfiles. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially-crafted XSLT\nfilter description or extension file that, when opened, would cause the\nOpenOffice.org Extension Manager to modify files accessible to the user\ninstalling the JAR or extension file. (CVE-2010-3450)\nA flaw was found in the script that launches OpenOffice.org. In some\nsituations, a \".\" character could be included in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH\nvariable, allowing a local attacker to execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user running OpenOffice.org, if that user ran\nOpenOffice.org from within an attacker-controlled directory.\n(CVE-2010-3689)\nRed Hat would like to thank OpenOffice.org for reporting the CVE-2010-3451,\nCVE-2010-3452, CVE-2010-3453, CVE-2010-3454, and CVE-2010-4643 issues; and\nDmitri Gribenko for reporting the CVE-2010-3689 issue. Upstream\nacknowledges Dan Rosenberg of Virtual Security Research as the original\nreporter of the CVE-2010-3451, CVE-2010-3452, CVE-2010-3453, and\nCVE-2010-3454 issues.\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n* OpenOffice.org did not create a lock file when opening a file that was on\na share mounted via SFTP. Additionally, if there was a lock file, it was\nignored. This could result in data loss if a file in this situation was\nopened simultaneously by another user. (BZ#671087)\nAll OpenOffice.org users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running\ninstances of OpenOffice.org applications must be restarted for this update\nto take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
