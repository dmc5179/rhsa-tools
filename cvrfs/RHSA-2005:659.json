A number of bugs were found in various binutils tools.  \nSeveral integer overflow bugs were found in binutils. If a user is tricked\ninto processing a specially crafted executable with utilities such as\nreadelf, size, strings, objdump, or nm, it may allow the execution of\narbitrary code as the user running the utility. The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-1704\nto this issue.\nAdditionally, the following bugs have been fixed:\n-- correct alignment of .tbss section if the requested alignment\nof .tbss is bigger than requested alignment of .tdata section\n-- by default issue an error if IA-64 hint@pause instruction is\nput into the B slot, add assembler command line switch to\noverride this behaviour\nAll users of binutils should upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
