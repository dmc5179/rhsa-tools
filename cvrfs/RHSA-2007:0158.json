If a user tried to save and then view a carefully crafted memo,\narbitrary code may be executed as the user running Evolution. (CVE-2007-1002)\nThis flaw did not affect the versions of Evolution shipped with Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 2.1, 3, or 4.\nAll users of Evolution should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch which resolves this issue.\nRed Hat would like to thank Ulf Härnhammar of Secunia Research for\nreporting this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
