The CUPS \"pdftops\" filter converts Portable\nDocument Format (PDF) files to PostScript.\nTwo integer overflow flaws were found in the CUPS \"pdftops\" filter. An\nattacker could create a malicious PDF file that would cause \"pdftops\" to\ncrash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the \"lp\" user if the file\nwas printed. (CVE-2009-3608, CVE-2009-3609)\nRed Hat would like to thank Chris Rohlf for reporting the CVE-2009-3608\nissue.\nUsers of cups are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to correct these issues. After installing the\nupdate, the cupsd daemon will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
