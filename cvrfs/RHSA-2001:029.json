These packages fix an\ninstance of the common 'format string' vulnerability,\nand correct an incompatibilty with the current errata\nIMAP server.\nIt is recommended that all mutt users using Red Hat Linux\nupgrade to the new packages. The version of mutt shipped\nin Red Hat Linux 7.0 does not contain the format string\nvulnerability; it is merely a bugfix update.\nUsers of Red Hat Linux 6.0 and 6.1 should use the\npackages for Red Hat Linux 6.2. Additionally, the packages\nfor Red Hat Linux 6.2 have support for SSL-IMAP and GSSAPI; the\nnew packages require the openssl enhancement errata.","An example of a 'format string' vulnerability was present in the\nIMAP code in versions of mutt previous to 1.2.5. This had the\neffect that a compromised or malicious IMAP server could possibly\nexecute code on the local machine.\nThe mutt packages in Red Hat Linux 7.0 were incompatible\nwith the errata IMAP server released for Red Hat Linux in\nregards to GSSAPI authentication.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
