If very\nlong strings were passed to the str_replace() function, an integer\noverflow could occur in memory allocation. If a script used the\nimap_mail_compose() function to create a new MIME message based on an\ninput body from an untrusted source, it could result in a heap overflow.\nAn attacker with access to a PHP application affected by any these issues\ncould trigger the flaws and possibly execute arbitrary code as the\n'apache' user. (CVE-2007-0906)\nWhen unserializing untrusted data on 64-bit platforms, the\nzend_hash_init() function could be forced into an infinite loop, consuming\nCPU resources for a limited time, until the script timeout alarm aborted\nexecution of the script. (CVE-2007-0988)\nIf the wddx extension was used to import WDDX data from an untrusted\nsource, certain WDDX input packets could expose a random portion of heap\nmemory. (CVE-2007-0908)\nIf the odbc_result_all() function was used to display data from a database,\nand the database table contents were under an attacker's control, a format\nstring vulnerability was possible which could allow arbitrary code\nexecution. (CVE-2007-0909)\nA one byte memory read always occurs before the beginning of a buffer. This\ncould be triggered, for example, by any use of the header() function in a\nscript. However it is unlikely that this would have any effect.\n(CVE-2007-0907)\nSeveral flaws in PHP could allow attackers to \"clobber\" certain\nsuper-global variables via unspecified vectors. (CVE-2007-0910)\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.\nRed Hat would like to thank Stefan Esser for his help diagnosing these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
