An attacker could\ncreate a malicious PDF file that would cause applications that use poppler\n(such as Evince) to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code when\nopened. (CVE-2009-3603, CVE-2009-3608, CVE-2009-3609)\nRed Hat would like to thank Chris Rohlf for reporting the CVE-2009-3608\nissue.\nThis update also corrects a regression introduced in the previous poppler\nsecurity update, RHSA-2009:0480, that prevented poppler from rendering\ncertain PDF documents correctly. (BZ#528147)\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
