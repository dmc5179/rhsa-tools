(CVE-2008-1232)\nAn additional cross-site scripting vulnerability was discovered in the host\nmanager application. A remote attacker could inject arbitrary web script or\nHTML via the hostname parameter.

A remote attacker could utilize a\nspecially-crafted request parameter to access protected web resources.\n(CVE-2008-2370)\nAn additional traversal vulnerability was discovered when the\n\"allowLinking\" and \"URIencoding\" settings were activated. A remote attacker\ncould use a UTF-8-encoded request to extend their privileges and obtain\nlocal files accessible to the Tomcat process. (CVE-2008-2938)\nUsers of tomcat should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
