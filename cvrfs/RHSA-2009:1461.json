This update fixes several\nsecurity issues and adds various enhancements.\nThis update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.","Red Hat Application Stack v2.4 is an integrated open source application\nstack, that includes Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and JBoss Enterprise\nApplication Platform (EAP). JBoss EAP is provided through the JBoss EAP\nchannels on the Red Hat Network.\nPostgreSQL was updated to version 8.2.14, fixing the following security\nissues:\nA flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL handles LDAP-based authentication.\nIf PostgreSQL was configured to use LDAP authentication and the LDAP server\nwas configured to allow anonymous binds, anyone able to connect to a given\ndatabase could use this flaw to log in as any database user, including a\nPostgreSQL superuser, without supplying a password. (CVE-2009-3231)\nIt was discovered that the upstream patch for CVE-2007-6600 included in the\nRed Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2008:0040 did not include protection against\nmisuse of the RESET ROLE and RESET SESSION AUTHORIZATION commands. An\nauthenticated user could use this flaw to install malicious code that would\nlater execute with superuser privileges. (CVE-2009-3230)\nA flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL handles external plug-ins. This flaw\ncould allow remote, authenticated users without superuser privileges to\ncrash the back-end server by using the LOAD command on libraries in\n\"/var/lib/pgsql/plugins/\" that have already been loaded, causing a\ntemporary denial of service during crash recovery. (CVE-2009-3229)\nMySQL was updated to version 5.0.84, fixing the following security issues:\nAn insufficient HTML entities quoting flaw was found in the mysql command\nline client's HTML output mode. If an attacker was able to inject arbitrary\nHTML tags into data stored in a MySQL database, which was later retrieved\nusing the mysql command line client and its HTML output mode, they could\nperform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against victims viewing the\nHTML output in a web browser. (CVE-2008-4456)\nMultiple format string flaws were found in the way the MySQL server logs\nuser commands when creating and deleting databases. A remote, authenticated\nattacker with permissions to CREATE and DROP databases could use these\nflaws to formulate a specifically-crafted SQL command that would cause a\ntemporary denial of service (open connections to mysqld are terminated).\n(CVE-2009-2446)\nNote: To exploit the CVE-2009-2446 flaws, the general query log (the mysqld\n\"--log\" command line option or the \"log\" option in \"/etc/my.cnf\") must be\nenabled. This logging is not enabled by default.\nPHP was updated to version 5.2.10, fixing the following security issue:\nAn insufficient input validation flaw was discovered in the PHP\nexif_read_data() function, used to read Exchangeable image file format\n(Exif) metadata from images. An attacker could create a specially-crafted\nimage that could cause the PHP interpreter to crash or disclose portions of\nits memory while reading the Exif metadata from the image. (CVE-2009-2687)\nApache httpd has been updated with backported patches to correct the\nfollowing security issues:\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Apache mod_proxy_ftp\nmodule. A malicious FTP server to which requests are being proxied could\nuse this flaw to crash an httpd child process via a malformed reply to the\nEPSV or PASV commands, resulting in a limited denial of service.\n(CVE-2009-3094)\nA second flaw was found in the Apache mod_proxy_ftp module. In a reverse\nproxy configuration, a remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass\nintended access restrictions by creating a carefully-crafted HTTP\nAuthorization header, allowing the attacker to send arbitrary commands to\nthe FTP server. (CVE-2009-3095)\nAlso, the following packages have been updated:\n* postgresql-jdbc to 8.2.510\n* php-pear to 1.8.1\n* perl-DBI to 1.609\n* perl-DBD-MySQL to 4.012\nAll users should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve these\nissues. Users must restart the individual services, including postgresql,\nmysqld, and httpd, for this update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
