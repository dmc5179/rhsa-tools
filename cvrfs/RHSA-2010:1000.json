A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\nbase score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the\nCVE link in the References section.","The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain\nName System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver\nlibrary (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and\ntools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.\nIt was discovered that named did not invalidate previously cached SIG\nrecords when adding an NCACHE record for the same entry to the cache. A\nremote attacker allowed to send recursive DNS queries to named could use\nthis flaw to crash named. (CVE-2010-3613)\nAll BIND users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing the\nupdate, the BIND daemon (named) will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
