available for Red Hat CloudForms 4.2.","Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine delivers the insight, control, and automation needed to address the challenges of managing virtual environments. CloudForms Management Engine is built on Ruby on Rails, a model-view controller (MVC) framework for web application development. Action Pack implements the controller and the view components.\nThis update fixes various bugs and adds several enhancements. Documentation for these changes is available in the Release Notes linked to in the References section.\nSecurity Fix(es):\n* A logic error in valid_role() in CloudForms role validation could allow a\ntenant administrator to create groups with a higher privilege level than\nthe tenant administrator should have. This would allow an attacker with\ntenant administration access to elevate privileges. (CVE-2017-2632)\nThis issue was discovered by Matouš Mojžíš (Red Hat).\nAll CFME users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
