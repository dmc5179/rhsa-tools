Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,\nwhich give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability\nfrom the CVE links in the References section.","Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients,\nsupporting FTP, Gopher, and HTTP data objects.\nA flaw was found in the way Squid processed certain external ACL helper\nHTTP header fields that contained a delimiter that was not a comma. A\nremote attacker could issue a crafted request to the Squid server, causing\nexcessive CPU use (up to 100%). (CVE-2009-2855)\nNote: The CVE-2009-2855 issue only affected non-default configurations that\nuse an external ACL helper script.\nA flaw was found in the way Squid handled truncated DNS replies. A remote\nattacker able to send specially-crafted UDP packets to Squid's DNS client\nport could trigger an assertion failure in Squid's child process, causing\nthat child process to exit. (CVE-2010-0308)\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n* Squid's init script returns a non-zero value when trying to stop a\nstopped service. This is not LSB compliant and can generate difficulties in\ncluster environments. This update makes stopping LSB compliant. (BZ#521926)\n* Squid is not currently built to support MAC address filtering in ACLs.\nThis update includes support for MAC address filtering. (BZ#496170)\n* Squid is not currently built to support Kerberos negotiate\nauthentication. This update enables Kerberos authentication. (BZ#516245)\n* Squid does not include the port number as part of URIs it constructs when\nconfigured as an accelerator. This results in a 403 error. This update\ncorrects this behavior. (BZ#538738)\n* the error_map feature does not work if the same handling is set also on\nthe HTTP server that operates in deflate mode. This update fixes this\nissue. (BZ#470843)\nAll users of squid should upgrade to this updated package, which resolves\nthese issues. After installing this update, the squid service will be\nrestarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
