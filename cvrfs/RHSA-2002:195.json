Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2002:195"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Important","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated packages for dvips are available which fix a vulnerability allowing\nprint users to execute arbitrary commands.\n[Updated 13 Aug 2003]\nAdded tetex-doc package that was originally left out of the errata.","The dvips utility converts DVI format into PostScript(TM), and is used in\nRed Hat Linux as a print filter for printing DVI files. A vulnerability\nhas been found in dvips which uses the system() function insecurely when\nmanaging fonts.\nSince dvips is used in a print filter, this allows local or remote\nattackers who have print access to carefully craft a print job that allows\nthem to execute arbitrary code as the user 'lp'. \nA work around for this vulnerability is to remove the print filter for DVI\nfiles. The following commands, run as root, will accomplish this:\nrm -f /usr/share/printconf/mf_rules/mf40-tetex_filters\nrm -f /usr/lib/rhs/rhs-printfilters/dvi-to-ps.fpi\nHowever, to fix the problem in the dvips utility as well as remove the\nprint filter we recommend that all users upgrade to the these packages\ncontained within this erratum which contain a patch for this issue.\nThis vulnerability was discovered by Olaf Kirch of SuSE.\nAdditionally, the file /var/lib/texmf/ls-R had world-writable permissions.\nThis issue is also fixed by the packages contained within this erratum.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
