This update fixes several\nsecurity issues and adds various enhancements.\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.","Red Hat Application Stack v2.3 is an integrated open source application\nstack, that includes Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and JBoss Enterprise\nApplication Platform (EAP). JBoss EAP is provided through the JBoss EAP\nchannels on the Red Hat Network.\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the perl-DBD-Pg\npg_getline function implementation. If the pg_getline or getline functions\nread large, untrusted records from a database, it could cause an\napplication using these functions to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2009-0663)\nNote: After installing this update, pg_getline may return more data than\nspecified by its second argument, as this argument will be ignored. This is\nconsistent with current upstream behavior. Previously, the length limit\n(the second argument) was not enforced, allowing a buffer overflow.\nA memory leak flaw was found in the perl-DBD-Pg function performing the\nde-quoting of BYTEA type values acquired from a database. An attacker able\nto cause an application using perl-DBD-Pg to perform a large number of SQL\nqueries returning BYTEA records, could cause the application to use\nexcessive amounts of memory or, possibly, crash. (CVE-2009-1341)\nMySQL was updated to version 5.0.79, fixing the following security issues:\nA flaw was found in the way MySQL handles an empty bit-string literal. A\nremote, authenticated attacker could crash the MySQL server daemon (mysqld)\nif they used an empty bit-string literal in an SQL statement. This issue\nonly caused a temporary denial of service, as the MySQL daemon was\nautomatically restarted after the crash. (CVE-2008-3963)\nIt was discovered that the Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2008:0505, for\nRed Hat Application Stack v2.1, provided an incomplete fix for the flaw\nwhere MySQL did not correctly check directories used as arguments for the\nDATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY directives. Using this flaw, an\nauthenticated attacker could elevate their access privileges to tables\ncreated by other database users. Note: This attack does not work on\nexisting tables. An attacker can only elevate their access to another\nuser's tables as the tables are created. As well, the names of these\ncreated tables need to be predicted correctly for this attack to succeed.\n(CVE-2008-4098)\nPostgreSQL was updated to version 8.2.13, fixing the following security\nissue:\nA flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL handles encoding conversion. A\nremote, authenticated user could trigger an encoding conversion failure,\npossibly leading to a temporary denial of service. (CVE-2009-0922)\nAlso, the following packages have been updated:\n* httpd to 2.2.11\n* mysql-connector-odbc to 3.51.27r695\n* perl-DBD-MySQL to 4.010-1.el5s2\n* php to 5.2.9\n* postgresql-jdbc to 8.2.509\n* postgresqlclient81 to 8.1.17\nAll users should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve these\nissues. Users must restart the individual services, including postgresql,\nmysqld, and httpd, for this update to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
