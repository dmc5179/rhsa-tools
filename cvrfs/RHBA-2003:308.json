Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of\nup2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be\ndownloaded directly from the RHN website:\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2003:308"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Important","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated kernel packages are now available that allow 32-bit\ncompatibility-mode applications to utilize a larger address space on the\nAMD64 architecture.\n[Updated 01 Dec 2003]\nNote: This errata also fixed a bug in the do_brk() function, which has now\nbeen found to have security consequences: allowing a local attacker to gain\nroot privileges (CAN-2003-0961).  There is no change to the packages\nassociated with this advisory.","The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.\nThe initial release of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 kernel for the AMD64\narchitecture limited the amount of virtual address space available to\napplications compiled on a 32-bit (x86) architecture to an unnecessary \ndegree.  A side effect of this restriction was that some applications\nwith large address space requirements might execute successfully on an \nx86-based platform, but might not run on an AMD64-based platform.\nThese updated kernel packages significantly raise this address space limit.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
