The skb->dst data structure was not\nproperly validated in the ipv6_hop_jumbo() function. This could possibly\nlead to a remote denial of service. (CVE-2007-4567, Important)\n* the possibility of a timeout value overflow was found in the Linux kernel\nhigh-resolution timers functionality, hrtimers. This could allow a local,\nunprivileged user to execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service\n(kernel panic). (CVE-2007-5966, Important)\n* memory leaks were found on some error paths in the icmp_send()\nfunction in the Linux kernel. This could, potentially, cause the network\nconnectivity to cease. (CVE-2009-0778, Important)\n* a deficiency was found in the Linux kernel system call auditing\nimplementation on 64-bit systems. This could allow a local, unprivileged\nuser to circumvent a system call audit configuration, if that configuration\nfiltered based on the \"syscall\" number or arguments. (CVE-2009-0834,\nImportant)\n* a flaw was found in the Intel PRO/1000 Linux driver (e1000) in the Linux\nkernel. Frames with sizes near the MTU of an interface may be split across\nmultiple hardware receive descriptors. Receipt of such a frame could leak\nthrough a validation check, leading to a corruption of the length check. A\nremote attacker could use this flaw to send a specially-crafted packet that\nwould cause a denial of service or code execution. (CVE-2009-1385,\nImportant)\n* the ADDR_COMPAT_LAYOUT and MMAP_PAGE_ZERO flags were not cleared when a\nsetuid or setgid program was executed. A local, unprivileged user could use\nthis flaw to bypass the mmap_min_addr protection mechanism and perform a\nNULL pointer dereference attack, or bypass the Address Space Layout\nRandomization (ASLR) security feature. (CVE-2009-1895, Important)\n* a flaw was found in each of the following Intel PRO/1000 Linux drivers in\nthe Linux kernel: e1000 and e1000e. A remote attacker using packets larger\nthan the MTU could bypass the existing fragment check, resulting in\npartial, invalid frames being passed to the network stack. These flaws\ncould also possibly be used to trigger a remote denial of service.\n(CVE-2009-4536, CVE-2009-4538, Important)\n* a flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux\nkernel. Receiving overly-long frames with a certain revision of the network\ncards supported by this driver could possibly result in a remote denial of\nservice. (CVE-2009-4537, Important)\nNote: This update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these bug\nfixes will be available shortly from\nwww.redhat.com/docs/en-US/errata/RHSA-2010-0079/Kernel_Security_Update/\nindex.html\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
