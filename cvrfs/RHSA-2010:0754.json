The CUPS \"pdftops\" filter converts Portable\nDocument Format (PDF) files to PostScript.\nAn uninitialized pointer use flaw was discovered in the CUPS \"pdftops\"\nfilter. An attacker could create a malicious PDF file that, when printed,\nwould cause \"pdftops\" to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as\nthe \"lp\" user.
