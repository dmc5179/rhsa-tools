In certain situations, a remote attacker\ncould trigger this flaw by sending a malicious packet over a wireless\nnetwork, causing a denial of service (kernel crash).\n(CVE-2007-4997, Important)\nA memory leak was found in the Red Hat Content Accelerator kernel patch.\nA local user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory\nexhaustion). (CVE-2007-5494, Important)\nAdditionally, the following bugs were fixed:\n* when running the \"ls -la\" command on an NFSv4 mount point, incorrect\nfile attributes, and outdated file size and timestamp information were\nreturned. As well, symbolic links may have been displayed as actual files.\n* a bug which caused the cmirror write path to appear deadlocked after a\nsuccessful recovery, which may have caused syncing to hang, has been\nresolved.\n* a kernel panic which occurred when manually configuring LCS interfaces on\nthe IBM S/390 has been resolved.\n* when running a 32-bit binary on a 64-bit system, it was possible to\nmmap page at address 0 without flag MAP_FIXED set. This has been\nresolved in these updated packages.\n* the Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI) Watchdog did not increment the NMI\ninterrupt counter in \"/proc/interrupts\" on systems running an AMD Opteron\nCPU. This caused systems running NMI Watchdog to restart at regular\nintervals.\n* a bug which caused the diskdump utility to run very slowly on devices\nusing Fusion MPT has been resolved.\nAll users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve\nthese issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
