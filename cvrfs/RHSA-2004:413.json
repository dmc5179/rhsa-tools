These consist of invalid conversions of 64 to 32-bit file\noffset pointers and possible race conditions.  A local unprivileged user\ncould make use of these flaws to access large portions of kernel memory. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-0415 to this issue.  \nThese packages contain a patch written by Al Viro to correct these flaws. \nRed Hat would like to thank iSEC Security Research for disclosing this\nissue and a number of vendor-sec participants for reviewing and working on\nthe patch to this issue.\nIn addition, these packages correct a number of minor security issues:\nAn bug in the e1000 network driver.  This bug could be used by local users\nto leak small amounts of kernel memory (CAN-2004-0535).\nA bug in the SoundBlaster 16 code which does not properly handle certain\nsample sizes.  This flaw could be used by local users to crash a system \n(CAN-2004-0178).\nA possible NULL-pointer dereference in the Linux kernel prior to 2.4.26 on\nthe Itanium platform could allow a local user to crash a system\n(CAN-2004-0447).\nInappropriate permissions on /proc/scsi/qla2300/HbaApiNode (CAN-2004-0587).\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 users are advised to upgrade their\nkernels to the packages associated with their machine architectures\nand configurations as listed in this erratum.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
