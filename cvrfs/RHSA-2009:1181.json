BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver\nlibrary (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and\ntools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.\nA flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message packets\ncontaining the \"ANY\" record type. A remote attacker could use this flaw to\nsend a specially-crafted dynamic update packet that could cause named to\nexit with an assertion failure. (CVE-2009-0696)\nNote: even if named is not configured for dynamic updates, receiving such\na specially-crafted dynamic update packet could still cause named to exit\nunexpectedly.\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n* the following message could have been logged: \"internal_accept: fcntl()\nfailed: Too many open files\". With these updated packages, timeout queries\nare aborted in order to reduce the number of open UDP sockets, and when the\naccept() function returns an EMFILE error value, that situation is now\nhandled gracefully, thus resolving the issue. (BZ#498164)\nAll BIND users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the\nupdate, the BIND daemon (named) will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
