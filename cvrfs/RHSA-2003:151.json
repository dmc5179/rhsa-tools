This vulnerability\nallows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop).\nThe Red Hat tcpdump packages advertise that, by default, tcpdump will drop\nprivileges to user 'pcap'.  Due to a compilation error this did not\nhappen, and tcpdump would run as root unless the '-U' flag was specified.\nUsers of tcpdump are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which\ncontain a patch correcting the RADIUS issue and are compiled so that by\ndefault tcpdump will drop privileges to the 'pcap' user.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
