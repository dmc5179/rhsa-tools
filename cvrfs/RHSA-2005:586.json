It is possible\nthat Web content could generate events such as keystrokes or mouse clicks\nthat could be used to steal data or execute malicious JavaScript code. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2005-2260 to this issue.\nA bug was found in the way Firefox executed Javascript in XBL controls. It\nis possible for a malicious webpage to leverage this vulnerability to\nexecute other JavaScript based attacks even when JavaScript is disabled.\n(CAN-2005-2261)\nA bug was found in the way Firefox set an image as the desktop wallpaper.\nIf a user chooses the \"Set As Wallpaper...\" context menu item on a\nspecially crafted image, it is possible for an attacker to execute\narbitrary code on a victim's machine. (CAN-2005-2262)\nA bug was found in the way Firefox installed its extensions. If a user can\nbe tricked into visiting a malicious webpage, it may be possible to obtain\nsensitive information such as cookies or passwords. (CAN-2005-2263)\nA bug was found in the way Firefox handled the _search target. It is\npossible for a malicious website to inject JavaScript into an already open\nwebpage. (CAN-2005-2264)\nA bug was found in the way Firefox handled certain Javascript functions. It\nis possible for a malicious web page to crash the browser by executing\nmalformed Javascript code. (CAN-2005-2265)\nA bug was found in the way Firefox handled multiple frame domains. It is\npossible for a frame as part of a malicious web site to inject content into\na frame that belongs to another domain. This issue was previously fixed as\nCAN-2004-0718 but was accidentally disabled. (CAN-2005-1937)\nA bug was found in the way Firefox handled child frames. It is possible for\na malicious framed page to steal sensitive information from its parent\npage. (CAN-2005-2266)\nA bug was found in the way Firefox opened URLs from media players. If a\nmedia player opens a URL that is JavaScript, JavaScript is executed\nwith access to the currently open webpage. (CAN-2005-2267)\nA design flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed alerts and prompts.\nAlerts and prompts were given the generic title [JavaScript Application]\nwhich prevented a user from knowing which site created them. (CAN-2005-2268)\nA bug was found in the way Firefox handled DOM node names. It is possible\nfor a malicious site to overwrite a DOM node name, allowing certain\nprivileged chrome actions to execute the malicious JavaScript. (CAN-2005-2269)\nA bug was found in the way Firefox cloned base objects. It is possible for\nWeb content to navigate up the prototype chain to gain access to privileged\nchrome objects. (CAN-2005-2270)\nUsers of Firefox are advised to upgrade to this updated package that\ncontains Firefox version 1.0.6 and is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
