If a user can be\ntricked into running bzgrep on a file with a carefully crafted file name,\narbitrary commands could be executed as the user running bzgrep. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCVE-2005-0758 to this issue.\nA bug was found in the way bzip2 modifies file permissions during\ndecompression. If an attacker has write access to the directory into which\nbzip2 is decompressing files, it is possible for them to modify permissions\non files owned by the user running bzip2 (CVE-2005-0953).\nA bug was found in the way bzip2 decompresses files. It is possible for an\nattacker to create a specially crafted bzip2 file which will cause bzip2 to\ncause a denial of service (by filling disk space) if decompressed by a\nvictim (CVE-2005-1260).\nUsers of Bzip2 should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
