update for imgbased, redhat-release-virtualization-host, and redhat-virtualization-host is now available for Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.","The redhat-virtualization-host packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks. \nSecurity Fix(es):\n* sudo: Heap buffer overflow in argument parsing (CVE-2021-3156)\n* dnsmasq: loose address/port check in reply_query() makes forging replies easier for an off-path attacker (CVE-2020-25684)\n* dnsmasq: loose query name check in reply_query() makes forging replies easier for an off-path attacker (CVE-2020-25685)\n* dnsmasq: multiple queries forwarded for the same name makes forging replies easier for an off-path attacker (CVE-2020-25686)\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\nBug Fix(es):\n* Previously, the Red Hat Virtualization Host (RHV-H) repository (rhvh-4-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms) did not include the libsmbclient package, which is a dependency for the sssd-ad package. Consequently, the sssd-ad package failed to install.\nWith this update, the libsmbclient is now in the RHV-H repository, and sssd-ad now installs on RHV-H.
