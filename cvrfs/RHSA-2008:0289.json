If a client connected to a malicious Samba server, it\nwas possible to execute arbitrary code as the Samba client user. It was\nalso possible for a remote user to send a specially crafted print request\nto a Samba server that could result in the server executing the vulnerable\nclient code, resulting in arbitrary code execution with the permissions of\nthe Samba server. (CVE-2008-1105)\nRed Hat would like to thank Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research for\nresponsibly disclosing this issue.\nUsers of Samba are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to resolve this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
