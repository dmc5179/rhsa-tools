This could allow a local, unprivileged user to prepare\nand run a specially-crafted binary which would use this deficiency to leak\nuninitialized and potentially sensitive data. (CVE-2008-0598, Important)\n* a possible kernel memory leak was found in the Linux kernel Simple\nInternet Transition (SIT) INET6 implementation. This could allow a local,\nunprivileged user to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2008-2136, Important)\n* missing capability checks were found in the SBNI WAN driver which could\nallow a local user to bypass intended capability restrictions.\n(CVE-2008-3525, Important)\n* the do_truncate() and generic_file_splice_write() functions did not clear\nthe setuid and setgid bits. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to\nobtain access to privileged information. (CVE-2008-4210, Important)\n* a buffer overflow flaw was found in Integrated Services Digital Network\n(ISDN) subsystem. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2007-6063, Moderate)\n* multiple NULL pointer dereferences were found in various Linux kernel\nnetwork drivers. These drivers were missing checks for terminal validity,\nwhich could allow privilege escalation. (CVE-2008-2812, Moderate)\n* a deficiency was found in the Linux kernel virtual filesystem (VFS)\nimplementation. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to attempt file\ncreation within deleted directories, possibly causing a denial of service.\n(CVE-2008-3275, Moderate)\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n* the incorrect kunmap function was used in nfs_xdr_readlinkres. kunmap()\nwas used where kunmap_atomic() should have been. As a consequence, if an\nNFSv2 or NFSv3 server exported a volume containing a symlink which included\na path equal to or longer than the local system's PATH_MAX, accessing the\nlink caused a kernel oops. This has been corrected in this update.\n* mptctl_gettargetinfo did not check if pIoc3 was NULL before using it as a\npointer. This caused a kernel panic in mptctl_gettargetinfo in some\ncircumstances. A check has been added which prevents this.\n* lost tick compensation code in the timer interrupt routine triggered\nwithout apparent cause. When running as a fully-virtualized client, this\nspurious triggering caused the 64-bit version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3\nto present highly inaccurate times. With this update the lost tick\ncompensation code is turned off when the operating system is running as a\nfully-virtualized client under Xen or VMWare®.\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 users should install this updated kernel\nwhich addresses these vulnerabilities and fixes these bugs.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
