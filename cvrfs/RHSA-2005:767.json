If a client connection is referred to a different server, it is\npossible that the referred connection will not be encrypted even if the\nclient has \"ssl start_tls\" in its ldap.conf file. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name CAN-2005-2069\nto this issue.\nA bug was found in the way the pam_ldap module processed certain failure\nmessages. If the server includes supplemental data in an authentication\nfailure result message, but the data does not include any specific error\ncode, the pam_ldap module would proceed as if the authentication request\nhad succeeded, and authentication would succeed. The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project has assigned the name CAN-2005-2641 to this issue. \nAdditionally the following issues are corrected in this erratum.\n- The OpenLDAP upgrading documentation has been updated.\n- Fix a database deadlock locking issue.\n- A fix where slaptest segfaults on exit after successful check.\n- The library libslapd_db-4.2.so is now located in an\narchitecture-dependent directory.\n- The LDAP client no longer enters an infinite loop when the server returns\na reference to itself.\n- The pam_ldap module adds the ability to check user passwords using a\ndirectory server to PAM-aware applications.\n- The directory server can now include supplemental information regarding\nthe state of the user's account if a client indicates that it supports\nsuch a feature.\nAll users of OpenLDAP and nss_ldap are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain backported fixes that resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
