An attacker could inject a carefully crafted frame\nonto the IEEE 802.11 network that could crash a running tcpdump session if\na certain link type was explicitly specified. (CVE-2007-1218)\nAn integer overflow flaw was found in tcpdump's BGP processing code. An\nattacker could execute arbitrary code with the privilege of the pcap user\nby injecting a crafted frame onto the network. (CVE-2007-3798)\nIn addition, the following bugs have been addressed: \n* if called with -C and -W switches, tcpdump would create the first\nsavefile with the privileges of the user that executed tcpdump (usually\nroot), rather than with ones of the pcap user.  This could result in the\ninability to save the complete traffic log file properly without the\nimmediate notice of the user running tcpdump.\n* the arpwatch service initialization script would exit prematurely,\nreturning a successful exit status incorrectly and preventing the status\ncommand from running in case networking is not available.\nUsers of tcpdump are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain backported patches that correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
