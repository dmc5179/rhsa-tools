It provides data structure handling for C, portability\nwrappers, and interfaces for such runtime functionality as an event loop,\nthreads, dynamic loading, and an object system.\nDiego Pettenò discovered multiple integer overflows causing heap-based\nbuffer overflows in GLib's Base64 encoding and decoding functions. An\nattacker could use these flaws to crash an application using GLib's Base64\nfunctions to encode or decode large, untrusted inputs, or, possibly,\nexecute arbitrary code as the user running the application. (CVE-2008-4316)\nNote: No application shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 uses the\naffected functions. Third-party applications may, however, be affected.\nAll users of glib2 should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
