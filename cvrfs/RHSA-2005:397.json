It is possible\nthat an attacker could create a specially crafted mail message that when\nopened by a victim causes Evolution to stop responding. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2005-0806 to this issue.\nA bug was also found in Evolution's helper program camel-lock-helper. This\nbug could allow a local attacker to gain root privileges if\ncamel-lock-helper has been built to execute with elevated privileges.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2005-0102 to this issue.  On Red Hat Enterprise Linux,\ncamel-lock-helper is not built to execute with elevated privileges by\ndefault.  Please note however that if users have rebuilt Evolution from the\nsource RPM, as the root user, camel-lock-helper may be given elevated\nprivileges.\nAll users of evolution should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ninclude backported fixes to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
