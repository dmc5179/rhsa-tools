This escape sequence takes the current title and places it directly\non the command line. An attacker can craft an escape sequence that sets the\nvictim's Xterm window title to an arbitrary command, and then reports it to\nthe command line. Since it is not possible to embed a carriage return into\nthe window title, the attacker would then have to convince the victim to\npress Enter for the shell to process the title as a command, although the\nattacker could craft other escape sequences that might convince the victim\nto do so. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\nhas assigned the name CAN-2003-0063 to this issue.\n- It is possible to lock up versions of Xterm by sending an invalid DEC\nUDK escape sequence. (CAN-2003-0071)\n- XFree86 4.2.1 also contains an updated fix for CAN-2002-0164, a\nvulnerability in the MIT-SHM extension of the X server that allows local\nusers to read and write arbitrary shared memory. The original fix did not\ncover the case where the X server is started from xdm.\n- The X server was setting the /dev/dri directory permissions incorrectly,\nwhich resulted in the directory being world writable. (CAN-2001-1409)\nDriver updates and additions:\n- Savage driver updated to Tim Roberts' latest version 1.1.27t\n- New \"cyrix\" driver which works better on MediaGX hardware.\n- New input drivers for Fujitsu Stylistic (fpit), Palmax   \nPD1000/PD1100 Input driver (palmax), Union Reality UR-98 head tracker   \n(ur98)\n- Backported apm driver, DPMS support enhancements, and a few accel fixes\n- Backported chips driver, with hardware mouse cursor and 2D acceleration \nfixes\n- Backported cirrus, i740, siliconmotion, and ark drivers\nVarious bug fixes and enhancements:\n- Stability improvements to RENDER extension and libraries\n- Various fixes to the Xaw library\n- Fix a long standing problem in the X server where the mouse, keyboard, or  \nvideo would hang, or the server to go into an endless loop whenever the  \nsystem time was changed backwards\n- Fix a crash in the Radeon and Rage 128 drivers using VMware with DGA \nwhen DRI is enabled\n- Work around some multihead and RENDER exention problems in the Matrox \n\"mga\" driver\n- fc-cache is now run upon font package installation in all font\ndirectories containing fonts managed by fontconfig/Xft\n- mkfontdir now forces the permissions of the files it generates to be mode \n0644 to ensure they are world readable independant of umask\n- A new option \"ForceLegacyCRT\" to the radeon driver allows use \nof legacy VGA monitors which can not be detected automatically.  This \noption is only safe to use in single-head setups and may cause serious \nproblems if used with dual-head.\n- xterm session management is now enabled by default, whereas the stock\nXFree86 default in 4.2.0/4.2.1 was accidentally disabled upstream\n- Removed and obsoleted the XFree86-xtrap-clients package, now merged\ninto the main XFree86 package\n- Added support for previously unsupported ATI Rage 128 video hardware\n- Fixed Polish euro support\n- Added neomagic Xvideo support which may work for some users\n- Added fix for deadkey-quotedbl in ISO8859-15\n- Disabled debug messages in Cirrus Logic driver\n- Fixed a bug in the VESA driver, where the X server would crash with\nan FPE when the DisplaySize option was used\n- Fix to ATI Mach64 support which was out of PCI specs causing problems  \non some Dell and IBM servers\n- Fix a problem which caused certain combinations of Radeon and Rage 128\nhardware and particular motherboards to hang, due to bus mastering\ngetting disabled when VT switching.\nThere are various other fixes included which users can review by examining\nthe RPM package changelog of any of the new XFree86 packages.\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these updated XFree86 4.2.1 packages, which\nare not vulnerable to the previously mentioned security issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
