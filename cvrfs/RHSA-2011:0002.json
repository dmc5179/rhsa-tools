Please reference the support policy\nhere:\nhttps://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/satellite/\nThough we are committed to the December 31st date for beginning the\nprocess of decommissioning Satellite and Proxy 4.x support, we recognize\nthat our customers have woven these products very deeply into their\nprocesses and may need some time to migrate.\nFor migration purposes, please note the following dates:\n- December 31st, 2010 - Satellite and Proxy 4.x ceased to be supported.\nOfficial support ended. Only Severity 1 issues and migration assistance\nwill be addressed. Satellite and Proxy will continue to operate, but all\ncustomers are encouraged to migrate in a timely manner.\n- April 30th, 2011 - Satellite and Proxy 4.x active status will be\nterminated. Satellite and Proxy version 4.x will enter an inactive\nstate. Satellite and Proxy communication to RHN Hosted will cease to\nfunction (for example, the satellite-sync command will no longer work).\nThe Satellite Upgrade process starting point is outlined here:\nhttp://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Network_Satellite/5.4/html/Installation_Guide/s1-upgrades.html\nHow to proceed:\n- All Satellite and Proxy 4.x users must plan to migrate to a newer version\nprior to April 30th, 2011.\n- If you have a Technical Account Manager, contact that person immediately\nto discuss migration plans.\n- Otherwise, contact support for assistance:\nhttps://www.redhat.com/apps/support/\n- Alternatively, Red Hat Consulting can be engaged to assist with a smooth\nmigration: http://www.redhat.com/consulting/\nMore information on Red Hat Consulting for Satellite can be found here:\nhttp://www.redhat.com/f/pdf/consulting/RHNSatelliteImplementation-Brochure.pdf\nIt is critical to ensure you have a plan to migrate off of Satellite and\nProxy 4.x prior to April 30th, 2011.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
