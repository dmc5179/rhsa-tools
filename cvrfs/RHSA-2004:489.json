Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains\nthe\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of\nup2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be\ndownloaded directly from the RHN website:\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2004:489"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Low","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated rh-postgresql packages that fix various bugs are now available.","PostgreSQL is an advanced Object-Relational database management system\n(DBMS) that supports almost all SQL constructs (including transactions,\nsubselects, and user-defined types and functions).\nTrustix has identified improper temporary file usage in the\nmake_oidjoins_check script.  It is possible that an attacker could\noverwrite arbitrary file contents as the user running the\nmake_oidjoins_check script.  This script has been removed from the RPM file\nsince it has no use to ordinary users.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0977 to\nthis issue.\nAdditionally, the following non-security issues have been addressed:\n- Fixed a low probability risk for loss of recently committed transactions.\n- Fixed a low probability risk for loss of older data due to failure to \nupdate transaction status.\n- A lock file problem that sometimes prevented automatic restart after a \nsystem crash has been fixed.\nAll users of rh-postgresql should upgrade to these updated packages, which\nresolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
