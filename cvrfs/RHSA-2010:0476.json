Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.","The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\nHypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor\nis a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes\neverything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Agent.\nNote: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for\nthe Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.\nA flaw was found in the way QEMU-KVM handled erroneous data provided by the\nLinux virtio-net driver, used by guest operating systems. Due to a\ndeficiency in the TSO (TCP segment offloading) implementation, a guest's\nvirtio-net driver would transmit improper data to a certain QEMU-KVM\nprocess on the host, causing the guest to crash. A remote attacker could\nuse this flaw to send specially-crafted data to a target guest system,\ncausing that guest to crash. (CVE-2010-0741)\nA flaw was found in the way the Virtual Desktop Server Manager (VDSM)\nhandled the removal of a virtual machine's (VM) data back end (such as an\nimage or a volume). When removing an image or a volume, it was not securely\ndeleted from its corresponding data domain as expected. A guest user in a\nnew, raw VM, created in a data domain that has had VMs deleted from it,\ncould use this flaw to read limited data from those deleted VMs,\npotentially disclosing sensitive information. (CVE-2010-2223)\nThis updated package provides updated components that include fixes for\nsecurity issues; however, these issues have no security impact for Red Hat\nEnterprise Virtualization Hypervisor. These fixes are for dbus issue\nCVE-2009-1189; kernel issues CVE-2010-0307, CVE-2010-0410, CVE-2010-0730,\nCVE-2010-1085, and CVE-2010-1086; openldap issue CVE-2009-3767; and sudo\nissues CVE-2010-0426, CVE-2010-0427, and CVE-2010-1163.\nThis update also fixes several bugs and adds several enhancements.\nDocumentation for these bug fixes and enhancements is available from\nhttp://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization/2.2/html/Servers-5.5-2.2_Hypervisor_Security_Update\nAs Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug\nfixes and enhancements from the KVM updates RHSA-2010:0271 and\nRHBA-2010:0419 have been included in this update. Also included are the bug\nfixes and enhancements from the Virtual Desktop Server Manager (VDSM)\nupdate RHSA-2010:0473, and fence-agents update RHBA-2010:0477.\nKVM: https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0271.html and\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2010-0419.html\nVDSM: https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0473.html\nfence-agents: https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2010-0477.html\nUsers of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to\nupgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues and adds these\nenhancements.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
