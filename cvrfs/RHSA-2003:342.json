Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate \nErrors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated \ncertificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat \nFTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003:342"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Important","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated EPIC packages which fix an exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability\nare now available.","EPIC (Enhanced Programmable ircII Client) is an advanced ircII chat\nclient designed to connect to Internet Relay Chat (IRC) servers.\nA bug in various versions of EPIC allows remote malicious IRC servers to\ncause a denial of service (crash) and execute arbitrary code via a CTCP\nrequest from a large nickname, which causes an incorrect length\ncalculation.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0328 to this issue.\nUsers of EPIC who may connect to untrusted servers are advised to upgrade\nto the packages in this erratum which contain a backported security fix to\ncorrect this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
