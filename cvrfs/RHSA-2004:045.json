Many of these bugs do not affect the version\nof Gaim distributed with version 2.1 of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. \nA buffer overflow exists in the HTTP Proxy connect code.  If Gaim is\nconfigured to use an HTTP proxy for connecting to a server, a malicious\nHTTP proxy could run arbitrary code as the user running Gaim.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0006 to this issue.\nAn integer overflow in Gaim 0.74 and earlier, when allocating memory for a\ndirectIM packet for AIM/Oscar, results in heap overflow. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0008 to this issue.\nUsers of Gaim should upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain\na backported security patch correcting this issue.\nRed Hat would like to thank Steffan Esser for finding and reporting these\nissues and Jacques A. Vidrine for providing initial patches.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
