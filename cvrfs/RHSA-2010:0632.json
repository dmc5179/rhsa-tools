A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,\nwhich gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in\nthe References section.","The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is a\nremote display protocol used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux for viewing\nvirtualized guests running on the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)\nhypervisor, or on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor.\nThe qspice-client package provides the client side of the SPICE protocol.\nA race condition was found in the way the SPICE Mozilla Firefox plug-in and\nthe SPICE client communicated. A local attacker could use this flaw to\ntrick the plug-in and the SPICE client into communicating over an\nattacker-controlled socket, possibly gaining access to authentication\ndetails, or resulting in a man-in-the-middle attack on the SPICE\nconnection. (CVE-2010-2792)\nUsers of qspice-client should upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains a backported patch to correct this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
