PHP applications may use the unserialize function on untrusted user\ndata, which could allow a remote attacker to gain access to memory or\npotentially execute arbitrary code.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1019 to\nthis issue.\nA flaw in the exif extension of PHP was found which lead to a stack\noverflow.  An attacker could create a carefully crafted image file in such\na way that if parsed by a PHP script using the exif extension it could\ncause a crash or potentially execute arbitrary code.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-1065 to this issue.\nAn information disclosure bug was discovered in the parsing of \"GPC\"\nvariables in PHP (query strings or cookies, and POST form data).  If\nparticular scripts used the values of the GPC variables, portions of the\nmemory space of an httpd child process could be revealed to the client. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-0958 to this issue.\nA file access bug was discovered in the parsing of \"multipart/form-data\"\nforms, used by PHP scripts which allow file uploads.  In particular\nconfigurations, some scripts could allow a malicious client to upload files\nto an arbitrary directory where the \"apache\" user has write access.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2004-0959 to this issue.\nFlaws were found in shmop_write, pack, and unpack PHP functions.  These\nfunctions are not normally passed user supplied data, so would require a\nmalicious PHP script to be exploited.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1018 to\nthis issue.\nVarious issues were discovered in the use of the \"select\" system call in\nPHP, which could be triggered if PHP is used in an Apache configuration\nwhere the number of open files (such as virtual host log files) exceeds the\ndefault process limit of 1024.  Workarounds are now included for some of\nthese issues.\nThe \"phpize\" shell script included in PHP can be used to build third-party\nextension modules.  A build issue was discovered in the \"phpize\" script on\nsome 64-bit platforms which prevented correct operation.\nThe \"pcntl\" extension module is now enabled in the command line PHP\ninterpreter, /usr/bin/php.  This module enables process control features \nsuch as \"fork\" and \"kill\" from PHP scripts.\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain fixes\nfor these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
