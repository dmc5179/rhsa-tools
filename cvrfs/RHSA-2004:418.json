These consist of invalid conversions of 64 to 32-bit file\noffset pointers and possible race conditions.  A local unprivileged user\ncould make use of these flaws to access large portions of kernel memory. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-0415 to this issue.\nThese packages contain a patch written by Al Viro to correct these flaws.\nRed Hat would like to thank iSEC Security Research for disclosing this\nissue and a number of vendor-sec participants for reviewing and working on\nthe patch to this issue.\nIn addition, these packages correct two minor issues:\nAn bug in the e1000 network driver. This bug could be used by local users\nto leak small amounts of kernel memory (CAN-2004-0535).\nInappropriate permissions on /proc/scsi/qla2300/HbaApiNode (CAN-2004-0587).\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 users are advised to upgrade their kernels\nto these erratum packages which contain backported patches to correct these\nissues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
