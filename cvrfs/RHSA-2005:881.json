It is\npossible for an attacker to cause perl to crash or execute arbitrary code\nif the attacker is able to process a malicious format string.  This issue\nis only exploitable through a script wich passes arbitrary untrusted\nstrings to the format string processor.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project assigned the name CVE-2005-3962 to this issue.\nPaul Szabo discovered a bug in the way Perl's File::Path::rmtree module\nremoved directory trees.  If a local user has write permissions to a\nsubdirectory within the tree being removed by File::Path::rmtree, it is\npossible for them to create setuid binary files.  (CVE-2005-0448)\nSolar Designer discovered several temporary file bugs in various Perl\nmodules.  A local attacker could overwrite or create files as the user\nrunning a Perl script that uses a vulnerable module.  (CVE-2004-0976)\nUsers of Perl are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues as well as fixes for\nseveral bugs.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
