(CVE-2008-0062, CVE-2008-0063)\nThis issue only affected krb5kdc with Kerberos v4 protocol compatibility\nenabled, which is the default setting on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.\nKerberos v4 protocol support can be disabled by adding \"v4_mode=none\"\n(without the quotes) to the \"[kdcdefaults]\" section of\n/var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kdc.conf.\nRed Hat would like to thank MIT for reporting these issues.\nA double-free flaw was discovered in the GSSAPI library used by MIT\nKerberos. This flaw could possibly cause a crash of the application using\nthe GSSAPI library. (CVE-2007-5971)\nAll krb5 users are advised to update to these erratum packages which\ncontain backported fixes to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
