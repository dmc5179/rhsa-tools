An attacker could\ncreate a carefully crafted LZW-encoded TIFF file that would cause an\napplication linked with libtiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2008-2327)\nRed Hat would like to thank Drew Yao of the Apple Product Security team for\nreporting this issue.\nA buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the tiff2pdf conversion program\ndistributed with libtiff. An attacker could create a TIFF file containing\nUTF-8 characters that would, when converted to PDF format, cause tiff2pdf\nto crash, or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2006-2193)\nAdditionally, these updated packages fix the following bug:\n* the libtiff packages included manual pages for the sgi2tiff and tiffsv\ncommands, which are not included in these packages. These extraneous manual\npages were removed.\nAll libtiff users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
