A\nremote attacker could potentially exploit these flaws to execute arbitrary\ncode.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the names CAN-2004-0642 and CAN-2004-0643 to these issues.\nA double-free bug was also found in the krb524 server (CAN-2004-0772),\nhowever this issue was fixed for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 users by a\nprevious erratum, RHSA-2003:052.\nAn infinite loop bug was found in the Kerberos 5 ASN.1 decoder library.  A\nremote attacker may be able to trigger this flaw and cause a denial of\nservice. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\nhas assigned the name CAN-2004-0644 to this issue.\nAll users of krb5 should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported security patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
