Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003:246"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Important","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated wu-ftpd packages are available that fix an off-by-one buffer overflow.","The wu-ftpd package contains the Washington University FTP (File Transfer\nProtocol) server daemon. FTP is a method of transferring files between\nmachines.\nAn off-by-one bug has been discovered in versions of wu-ftpd up to and\nincluding 2.6.2.  On a vulnerable system, a remote attacker would be able\nto exploit this bug to gain root privileges.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux contains a version of wu-ftpd that is affected by\nthis bug, although it is believed that this issue will not be remotely\nexploitable due to compiler padding of the buffer that is the target of the\noverflow.  However, Red Hat still advises that all users of wu-ftpd upgrade\nto these erratum packages, which contain a security patch.\nRed Hat would like to thank Wojciech Purczynski and Janusz Niewiadomski of\nISEC Security Research for their responsible disclosure of this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
