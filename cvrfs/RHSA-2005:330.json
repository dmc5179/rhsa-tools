An attacker may be able to execute\narbitrary code on a victim's machine if the victim can be tricked into\nconnecting to a malicious telnet server. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CAN-2005-0468 and\nCAN-2005-0469 to these issues.\nUsers of krb5 should update to these erratum packages which contain a\nbackported patch to correct this issue.\nRed Hat would like to thank iDEFENSE for their responsible disclosure of\nthis issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
