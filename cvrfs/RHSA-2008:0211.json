This could allow a local unprivileged\nuser to simultaneously execute code, which would otherwise be protected\nagainst parallel execution. As well, a race condition when handling locks\nin the Linux kernel fcntl functionality, may have allowed a process\nbelonging to a local unprivileged user to gain re-ordered access to the\ndescriptor table. (CVE-2008-1669, Important)\n* the absence of a protection mechanism when attempting to access a\ncritical section of code, as well as a race condition, have been found in\nthe Linux kernel file system event notifier, dnotify. This could allow a\nlocal unprivileged user to get inconsistent data, or to send arbitrary\nsignals to arbitrary system processes. (CVE-2008-1375, Important)\nRed Hat would like to thank Nick Piggin for responsibly disclosing the\nfollowing issue:\n* when accessing kernel memory locations, certain Linux kernel drivers\nregistering a fault handler did not perform required range checks. A local\nunprivileged user could use this flaw to gain read or write access to\narbitrary kernel memory, or possibly cause a kernel crash.\n(CVE-2008-0007, Important)\n* a flaw was found when performing asynchronous input or output operations\non a FIFO special file. A local unprivileged user could use this flaw to\ncause a kernel panic. (CVE-2007-5001, Important)\n* a flaw was found in the way core dump files were created. If a local user\ncould get a root-owned process to dump a core file into a directory, which\nthe user has write access to, they could gain read access to that core\nfile. This could potentially grant unauthorized access to sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2007-6206, Moderate)\n* a buffer overflow was found in the Linux kernel ISDN subsystem. A local\nunprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2007-6151, Moderate)\n* a race condition found in the mincore system core could allow a local\nuser to cause a denial of service (system hang). (CVE-2006-4814, Moderate)\n* it was discovered that the Linux kernel handled string operations in the\nopposite way to the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). This could allow a local\nunprivileged user to cause memory corruption. (CVE-2008-1367, Low)\nAs well, these updated packages fix the following bugs:\n* a bug, which caused long delays when unmounting mounts containing a large\nnumber of unused dentries, has been resolved.\n* in the previous kernel packages, the kernel was unable to handle certain\nfloating point instructions on Itanium(R) architectures.\n* on certain Intel CPUs, the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) was not\nflushed correctly, which caused machine check errors.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 3 users are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain backported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
