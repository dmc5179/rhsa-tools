Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.

If an account for a user is created, but marked as disabled using\nthe mksmbpasswd script, it is possible for Samba to overwrite the user's\npassword with the contents of an uninitialized buffer.  This might lead to\na disabled account becoming enabled with a password that could be guessed\nby an attacker.\nAlthough this is likely to be a low risk issue for most Samba users, we\nhave provided updated packages, which contain a backported patch correcting\nthis issue.\nRed Hat would like to thank the Samba team for reporting this issue and\nproviding us with a patch.\nNote: Due to a packaging error in samba-3.0.0-14.3E, the winbind daemon is\nnot automatically restarted when the Samba package is upgraded.  After\nup2date has installed the samba-3.0.2-4.3E packages, you must run\n\"/sbin/service winbind condrestart\" as root to restart the winbind daemon.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
