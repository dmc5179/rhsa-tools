Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate \nErrors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated \ncertificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat \nFTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2003:297"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Important","type":"Impact"}},"ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated stunnel packages are now available.  These updates address problems\nstemming from improper use of non-reentrant functions in signal handlers.","Stunnel is a wrapper for network connections. It can be used to tunnel an\nunencrypted network connection over an encrypted connection (encrypted\nusing SSL or TLS) or to provide an encrypted means of connecting to\nservices that do not natively support encryption.\nA previous advisory provided updated packages to address re-entrancy\nproblems in stunnel's signal-handling routines.  These updates did not\naddress other bugs that were found by Steve Grubb, and introduced an\nadditional bug, which was fixed in stunnel 3.26.\nAll users should upgrade to these errata packages, which address these\nissues by updating stunnel to version 3.26.\nNOTE: After upgrading, any instances of stunnel configured to run in daemon\nmode should be restarted, and any active network connections that are\ncurrently being serviced by stunnel should be terminated and reestablished.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
