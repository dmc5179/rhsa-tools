LDAP is a set of protocols for\naccessing directory services. In an audit of OpenLDAP by SuSE, a number of\npotential security issues were found:\nWhen reading configuration files, libldap would read the current user's\n.ldaprc file even in applications being run with elevated privileges.\nSlurpd would overflow an internal buffer if the command-line argument used\nwith the -t or -r flags was too long, or if the name of a file for which it\nattempted to create an advisory lock was too long.\nWhen parsing filters, the getfilter family of functions from libldap could\nbe made to overflow an internal buffer by supplying a carefully crafted\nldapfilter.conf file.\nWhen processing LDAP entry display templates, libldap could be made to\noverflow an internal buffer by supplying a properly crafted\nldaptemplates.conf file.\nWhen parsing an access control list, slapd could be made to overflow an\ninternal buffer.\nWhen constructing the name of the file used for logging rejected\nreplication requests, slapd would overflow an internal buffer if the size\nof the generated name was too large, and could be tricked into destroying\nthe contents of any file owned by the ldap user due to a race condition in\nthe subsequent creation of the log file.\nRed Hat Linux users who use LDAP are advised to install the updated\nopenldap packages which are not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
