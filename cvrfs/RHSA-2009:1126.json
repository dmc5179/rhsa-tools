An HTML mail message containing malicious content could execute\narbitrary JavaScript in the context of the mail message, possibly\npresenting misleading data to the user, or stealing sensitive information\nsuch as login credentials.

(CVE-2009-1836)\nNote: JavaScript support is disabled by default in Thunderbird. None of the\nabove issues are exploitable unless JavaScript is enabled.\nAll Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which\nresolves these issues.
