All requested Extensions were\nadded to the issued certificate even if constraints were defined in the\nCertificate Authority (CA) profile. An attacker could submit a CSR for a\nsubordinate CA certificate even if the CA configuration prohibited\nsubordinate CA certificates. This lead to a bypass of the intended security\npolicy, possibly simplifying man-in-the-middle attacks against users that\ntrust Certificate Authorities managed by Red Hat Certificate System.\n(CVE-2008-1676)\nAll users of Red Hat Certificate System 7.2 should upgrade to these updated\npackages, which resolves this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
