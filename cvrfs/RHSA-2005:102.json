It is\nused both for the systemwide message bus service, and as a\nper-user-login-session messaging facility.\nDan Reed discovered that a user can send and listen to messages on another\nuser's per-user session bus if they know the address of the socket. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2005-0201 to this issue.  In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, the\nper-user session bus is only used for printing notifications,  therefore\nthis issue would only allow a local user to examine or send additional\nprint notification messages.\nUsers of dbus are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain backported patches to correct this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
