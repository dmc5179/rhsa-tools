A\nremote attacker with valid authentication credentials who was able to\nconnect to a Satellite Server could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code\non the server as the 'apache' user. (CVE-2007-4132)\nUsers of Red Hat Network Satellite Server 5.0.0 are advised to upgrade to\n5.0.1 which removes the unused, vulnerable handler.\nNote: This issue did not affect the hosted version of Red Hat Network or\nversions of Red Hat Network Satellite Server prior to 5.0.0.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
