This\nupdate deprecates the Mozilla Suite in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 in favor\nof the supported SeaMonkey Suite.\nThis update also resolves a number of outstanding Mozilla security issues:\nSeveral flaws were found in the way Mozilla processed certain javascript\nactions. A malicious web page could execute arbitrary javascript\ninstructions with the permissions of \"chrome\", allowing the page to steal\nsensitive information or install browser malware. (CVE-2006-2776,\nCVE-2006-2784, CVE-2006-2785, CVE-2006-2787)\nSeveral denial of service flaws were found in the way Mozilla processed\ncertain web content. A malicious web page could crash firefox or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. These issues to date were not proven to be\nexploitable, but do show evidence of memory corruption. (CVE-2006-2779,\nCVE-2006-2780)\nA double-free flaw was found in the way Mozilla-mail displayed malformed\ninline vcard attachments. If a victim viewed an email message containing\na carefully crafted vcard it could execute arbitrary code as the user\nrunning Mozilla-mail. (CVE-2006-2781) \nA cross site scripting flaw was found in the way Mozilla processed Unicode\nByte-order-Mark (BOM) markers in UTF-8 web pages. A malicious web page\ncould execute a script within the browser that a web input sanitizer could\nmiss due to a malformed \"script\" tag. (CVE-2006-2783)\nA form file upload flaw was found in the way Mozilla handled javascript\ninput object mutation. A malicious web page could upload an arbitrary local\nfile at form submission time without user interaction. (CVE-2006-2782)\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way Mozilla called the\ncrypto.signText() javascript function. A malicious web page could crash the\nbrowser if the victim had a client certificate loaded. (CVE-2006-2778)\nTwo HTTP response smuggling flaws were found in the way Mozilla processed\ncertain invalid HTTP response headers. A malicious web site could return\nspecially crafted HTTP response headers which may bypass HTTP proxy\nrestrictions. (CVE-2006-2786)\nA double free flaw was found in the way the nsIX509::getRawDER method was\ncalled. If a victim visited a carefully crafted web page it could execute\narbitrary code as the user running Mozilla. (CVE-2006-2788)\nUsers of Mozilla are advised to upgrade to this update, which contains\nSeaMonkey version 1.0.2 that is not vulnerable to these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
