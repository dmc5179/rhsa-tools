grub2, shim, and fwupd is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.0 Update Services for SAP Solutions.\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n[Updated 3 August 2020]\nThe shim packages distributed with this erratum have a known bug that can cause the boot process to hang on some systems. To prevent boot problems, customers are strongly recommended not to use the shim packages released with this erratum, and instead to apply the newer packages within RHBA-2020:3264, that were released on 1 August 2020 to address this issue.","The grub2 packages provide version 2 of the Grand Unified Boot Loader (GRUB), a highly configurable and customizable boot loader with modular architecture. The packages support a variety of kernel formats, file systems, computer architectures, and hardware devices.\nThe shim package contains a first-stage UEFI boot loader that handles chaining to a trusted full boot loader under secure boot environments.\nThe fwupd packages provide a service that allows session software to update device firmware.\nSecurity Fix(es):\n* grub2: Crafted grub.cfg file can lead to arbitrary code execution during boot process (CVE-2020-10713)\n* grub2: grub_malloc does not validate allocation size allowing for arithmetic overflow and subsequent heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2020-14308)\n* grub2: Integer overflow in grub_squash_read_symlink may lead to heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2020-14309)\n* grub2: Integer overflow read_section_as_string may lead to heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2020-14310)\n* grub2: Integer overflow in grub_ext2_read_link leads to heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2020-14311)\n* grub2: Fail kernel validation without shim protocol (CVE-2020-15705)\n* grub2: Use-after-free redefining a function whilst the same function is already executing (CVE-2020-15706)\n* grub2: Integer overflow in initrd size handling (CVE-2020-15707)\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
