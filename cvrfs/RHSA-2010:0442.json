Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.","MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists of\nthe MySQL server daemon (mysqld) and many client programs and libraries.\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the way MySQL handled the parameters of\nthe MySQL COM_FIELD_LIST network protocol command (this command is sent\nwhen a client uses the MySQL mysql_list_fields() client library function).\nAn authenticated database user could send a request with an excessively\nlong table name to cause a temporary denial of service (mysqld crash) or,\npotentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the database\nserver. (CVE-2010-1850)\nA directory traversal flaw was found in the way MySQL handled the\nparameters of the MySQL COM_FIELD_LIST network protocol command. An\nauthenticated database user could use this flaw to obtain descriptions of\nthe fields of an arbitrary table using a request with a specially-crafted\ntable name. (CVE-2010-1848)\nA flaw was discovered in the way MySQL handled symbolic links to tables\ncreated using the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY directives in CREATE\nTABLE statements. An attacker with CREATE and DROP table privileges, and\nshell access to the database server, could use this flaw to remove data and\nindex files of tables created by other database users using the MyISAM\nstorage engine. (CVE-2010-1626)\nAll MySQL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing this\nupdate, the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
