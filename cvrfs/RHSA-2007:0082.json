If very\nlong strings were passed to the str_replace() function, an integer\noverflow could occur in memory allocation. If a script used the\nimap_mail_compose() function to create a new MIME message based on an\ninput body from an untrusted source, it could result in a heap overflow.\nAn attacker with access to a PHP application affected by any these issues\ncould trigger the flaws and possibly execute arbitrary code as the\n'apache' user. (CVE-2007-0906)\nWhen unserializing untrusted data on 64-bit platforms, the\nzend_hash_init() function could be forced into an infinite loop, consuming\nCPU resources for a limited time, until the script timeout alarm aborted\nexecution of the script. (CVE-2007-0988)\nIf the wddx extension was used to import WDDX data from an untrusted\nsource, certain WDDX input packets could expose a random portion of heap\nmemory. (CVE-2007-0908)\nIf the odbc_result_all() function was used to display data from a\ndatabase, and the database table contents were under an attacker's\ncontrol, a format string vulnerability was possible which could allow\narbitrary code execution. (CVE-2007-0909)\nA one byte memory read always occurs before the beginning of a buffer.\nThis could be triggered, for example, by any use of the header() function\nin a script. However it is unlikely that this would have any effect.\n(CVE-2007-0907)\nSeveral flaws in PHP could allow attackers to \"clobber\" certain\nsuper-global variables via unspecified vectors. (CVE-2007-0910)\nAn input validation bug allowed a remote attacker to trigger a denial of\nservice attack by submitting an input variable with a deeply-nested-array.\n(CVE-2007-1285)\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
