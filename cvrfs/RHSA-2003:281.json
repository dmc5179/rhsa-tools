Passwords for MySQL users are stored in the Password field of the\nuser table. Under this bug, a Password field with a value greater than 16\ncharacters can cause a buffer overflow. It may be possible for an attacker\nwith the ability to modify the user table to exploit this buffer overflow\nto execute arbitrary code as the MySQL user. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0780 to\nthis issue.\nUsers of MySQL are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages containing\nMySQL 3.23.58, which is not vulnerable to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
