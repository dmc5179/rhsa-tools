This overflow could be locally exploited if the library is\nlinked into a program that runs setuid or setgid.\nRed Hat Linux ships with a compatibility package 'ncurses4' that is\nactually based on ncurses version 5.0 but has been made ABI compatible\nwith ncurses 4.\nNo programs that ship with Red Hat Linux are exploitable.  A program could\nonly be exploited if it uses the ncurses 4 compatiblity package and if it\nis run setuid or setgid.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0062 to this issue.
