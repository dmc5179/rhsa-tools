XULRunner provides the XUL\nRuntime environment for Mozilla Firefox.\nSeveral flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web\npage containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,\npotentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.\n(CVE-2009-1392, CVE-2009-1832, CVE-2009-1833, CVE-2009-1837, CVE-2009-1838,\nCVE-2009-1841)\nMultiple flaws were found in the processing of malformed, local file\ncontent. If a user loaded malicious, local content via the file:// URL, it\nwas possible for that content to access other local data. (CVE-2009-1835,\nCVE-2009-1839)\nA script, privilege elevation flaw was found in the way Firefox loaded XML\nUser Interface Language (XUL) scripts. Firefox and certain add-ons could\nload malicious content when certain policy checks did not happen.\n(CVE-2009-1840)\nA flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed certain Unicode characters in\nInternational Domain Names (IDN). If an IDN contained invalid characters,\nthey may have been displayed as spaces, making it appear to the user that\nthey were visiting a trusted site. (CVE-2009-1834)\nA flaw was found in the way Firefox handled error responses returned from\nproxy servers. If an attacker is able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack\nagainst a Firefox instance that is using a proxy server, they may be able\nto steal sensitive information from the site the user is visiting.\n(CVE-2009-1836)\nFor technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security\nadvisories for Firefox 3.0.11. You can find a link to the Mozilla\nadvisories in the References section of this errata.\nAll Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nFirefox version 3.0.11, which corrects these issues. After installing the\nupdate, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
