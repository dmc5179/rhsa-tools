Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of\nup2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be\ndownloaded directly from the RHN website:\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt","type":"Vendor Fix","url":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2005:106"}},"threats":{"threat":{"description":"Low","type":"Impact"}},"acknowledgments":{"acknowledgment":{"description":"Red Hat would like to thank the MIT Kerberos Development Team for their responsible disclosure of this issue."}},"discovery_date":"2004-03-01T00:00:00Z","ordinal":"1"}],"document_notes":{"note":["Updated openssh packages that fix a potential security vulnerability and\nvarious other bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.\nThis update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat\nSecurity Response Team.","OpenSSH is OpenBSD's SSH (Secure SHell) protocol implementation. SSH\nreplaces rlogin and rsh, and provides secure encrypted communications\nbetween two untrusted hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and\narbitrary TCP/IP ports can also be forwarded over a secure channel. Public\nkey authentication can be used for \"passwordless\" access to servers.\nThe scp protocol allows a server to instruct a client to write to arbitrary\nfiles outside of the current directory. This could potentially cause a\nsecurity issue if a user uses scp to copy files from a malicious server.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-0175 to this issue.\nThese updated packages also correct the following bugs:\nOn systems where direct ssh access for the root user was disabled by\nconfiguration (setting \"PermitRootLogin no\"), attempts to guess the root\npassword could be judged as sucessful or unsucessful by observing a delay.\nOn systems where the privilege separation feature was turned on, the user\nresource limits were not correctly set if the configuration specified to\nraise them above the defaults.  It was also not possible to change an\nexpired password.\nUsers of openssh should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
