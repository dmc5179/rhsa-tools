A flaw in this mechanism has been found which can be used to\ncircumvent certain types of firewall configurations.\nNote: syncookies are not enabled in the default installation of Red Hat\nLinux but many server administrators do enable syncookies.","Syncookies, while not enabled in default installations of Red Hat Linux,\nare used to protect an Internet server against a certain type of DoS\nattack--the so called \"synflood\"--by using a cryptographic challenge\nprotocol which ensures legitimate users can keep using the server. Under an\nattack, the TCP/IP layer will, instead of just accepting new connections,\nsend back the challenge and only accept the connections in the\nsecond phase (\"syn ack\") of the TCP/IP handshake (where the other party\nreturns the challenge value). The DoS attack, which consists of sending as\nmany first phase (\"syn\") packets as possible will be neutralized because\nsystem resources are only used as part of the second phase.\nCertain firewall configurations only filter the first phase (\"syn\") packets\nto prevent connections to specific services. These systems are vulnerable\nwhen an attacker can both force a system into flood protection state (by\nstarting a synflood attack on a non-firewalled port) and guess the\ncryptographic challenge of a firewalled port. \nWhile the cryptographic hash used is strong, the number of bits available\nis restricted by the TCP protocol header design. With a high speed link and\na lot of time, an attacker can eventually succeed in faking a valid cookie\nand making a connection that a syn only firewall rule might have\nprohibited.\nThe updated kernels have a modified synflood protection algorithm that now\nuses a per port \"under attack\" state so that ports with only a first-phase\nfirewall rule will not use the \"under attack\" regime even when other,\nnon-firewalled, ports are under attack.\nIn addition, these packages fix a remote denial of service attack against\nthe TUX web server.  This attack can only succeed if the TUX web server\nhas been explicitly enabled; it is disabled by default.
