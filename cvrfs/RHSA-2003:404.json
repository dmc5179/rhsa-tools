Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\nup2date\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate \nErrors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated \ncertificate.

The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0963 to this issue.\nUsers of lftp are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain a backported security patch and are not vulnerable to this issue.\nRed Hat would like to thank Ulf Härnhammar for discovering and alerting us\nto this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
