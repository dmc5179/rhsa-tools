GnuTLS includes libtasn1, a library developed for\nASN.1 structures management that includes DER encoding and decoding.\nFlaws were found in the way GnuTLS handles malicious client connections. A\nmalicious remote client could send a specially crafted request to a service\nusing GnuTLS that could cause the service to crash. (CVE-2008-1948,\nCVE-2008-1949, CVE-2008-1950)\nWe believe it is possible to leverage the flaw CVE-2008-1948 to execute\narbitrary code but have been unable to prove this at the time of releasing\nthis advisory. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 does not ship with any\napplications directly affected by this flaw. Third-party software which\nruns on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 could, however, be affected by this\nvulnerability. Consequently, we have assigned it important severity.\nUsers of GnuTLS are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch that corrects these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
