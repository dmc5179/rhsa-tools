If a script uses the imap_mail_compose() function to create a\nnew MIME message based on an input body from an untrusted source, it could\nresult in a heap overflow.  An attacker who is able to access a PHP\napplication affected by any these issues could trigger these flaws and\npossibly execute arbitrary code as the 'apache' user. (CVE-2007-0906)\nIf unserializing untrusted data on 64-bit platforms, the zend_hash_init()\nfunction can be forced to enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU resources\nfor a limited length of time, until the script timeout alarm aborts\nexecution of the script. (CVE-2007-0988)\nIf the wddx extension is used to import WDDX data from an untrusted source,\ncertain WDDX input packets may allow a random portion of heap memory to be\nexposed. (CVE-2007-0908)\nIf the odbc_result_all() function is used to display data from a database,\nand the contents of the database table are under the control of an\nattacker, a format string vulnerability is possible which could lead to the\nexecution of arbitrary code.  (CVE-2007-0909)\nA one byte memory read will always occur before the beginning of a buffer,\nwhich could be triggered for example by any use of the header() function in\na script.  However it is unlikely that this would have any effect.\n(CVE-2007-0907)\nSeveral flaws in PHP could allows attackers to \"clobber\" certain\nsuper-global variables via unspecified vectors. (CVE-2007-0910)\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.\nRed Hat would like to thank Stefan Esser for his help diagnosing these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
