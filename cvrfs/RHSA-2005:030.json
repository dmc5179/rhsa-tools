A remote attacker who can communicate\nwith the LDAP service could trigger this flaw by creating a carefully\ncrafted attribute change request.  A sucessful exploit would lead to a\ndenial of service (crash) or potentially to remote code execution on the\nserver.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-1236 to this issue.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
