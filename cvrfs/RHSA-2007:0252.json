MTAs deliver\nmail from one machine to another. Sendmail is not a client program, but\nrather a behind-the-scenes daemon that moves email over networks or the\nInternet to its final destination.\nThe configuration of Sendmail on Red Hat Enterprise Linux was found to not\nreject the \"localhost.localdomain\" domain name for e-mail messages that\ncame from external hosts. This could have allowed remote attackers to\ndisguise spoofed messages (CVE-2006-7176).\nThis updated package also fixes the following bugs:\n* Infinite loop within tls read.\n* Incorrect path to selinuxenabled in initscript.\n* Build artifacts from sendmail-cf package.\n* Missing socketmap support.\n* Add support for CipherList configuration directive.\n* Path for aliases file.\n* Failure of shutting down sm-client.\n* Allows to specify persistent queue runners.\n* Missing dnl for SMART_HOST define.\n* Fixes connections stay in CLOSE_WAIT.\nAll users of Sendmail should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontains backported patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
