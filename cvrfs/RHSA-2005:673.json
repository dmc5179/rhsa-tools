A number of bugs were found in various binutils tools.  \nIf a user is tricked into processing a specially crafted executable with\nutilities such as readelf, size, strings, objdump, or nm, it may allow the\nexecution of arbitrary code as the user. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-1704 to\nthis issue.\nIn addition, the following bugs have been fixed:\n-- by default issue an error if IA-64 hint@pause instruction is\nput into the B slot, add assembler command line switch to\noverride this behaviour\n-- fix linker's --emit-relocs with .gnu.warning.* section symbols\n-- fix gprof on 64-bit ppc binaries and libraries\n-- fix gas mapping of register names to dwarf2 register numbers\nin CFI directives\nAll users of binutils should upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains patches to resolve these issues.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
