A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.","The gnutls packages provide the GNU Transport Layer Security (GnuTLS) library, which implements cryptographic algorithms and protocols such as SSL, TLS, and DTLS.\nNettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in almost any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages, such as C++, Python, or Pike, in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel space.\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: gnutls (3.6.16). (BZ#1956783)\nSecurity Fix(es):\n* nettle: Remote crash in RSA decryption via manipulated ciphertext (CVE-2021-3580)\n* gnutls: Use after free in client key_share extension (CVE-2021-20231)\n* gnutls: Use after free in client_send_params in lib/ext/pre_shared_key.c (CVE-2021-20232)\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\nAdditional Changes:\nFor detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.5 Release Notes linked from the References section.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
