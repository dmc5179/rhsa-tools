A number\nof issues have been found in the escape sequence handling of Rxvt.\nThese could be potentially exploited if an attacker can cause carefully\ncrafted escape sequences to be displayed on an rxvt terminal being used by\ntheir victim. \nOne of the features which most terminal emulators support is the ability\nfor the shell to set the title of the window using an escape sequence. \nCertain xterm variants, including rxvt, also provide an escape sequence for\nreporting the current window title.  This essentially takes the current\ntitle and places it directly on the command line.  Since it is not\npossible to embed a carriage return into the window title itself, the\nattacker would have to convince the victim to press the Enter key for the\ntitle to be processed as a command, although the attacker can perform a\nnumber of actions to increase the likelihood of this happening.\nA certain escape sequence when displayed in rxvt will create an arbitrary\nfile.  \nIt is possible to add malicious items to the dynamic menus through an\nescape sequence.\nUsers of Rxvt are advised to upgrade to these errata packages which contain\na patch to disable the title reporting functionality and patches to correct\nthe other issues.\nRed Hat would like to thank H D Moore for bringing these issues to our\nattention.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
