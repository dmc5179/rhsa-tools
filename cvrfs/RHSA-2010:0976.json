Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.","The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain\nName System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver\nlibrary (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and\ntools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.\nIt was discovered that named did not invalidate previously cached RRSIG\nrecords when adding an NCACHE record for the same entry to the cache. A\nremote attacker allowed to send recursive DNS queries to named could use\nthis flaw to crash named. (CVE-2010-3613)\nA flaw was found in the DNSSEC validation code in named. If named had\nmultiple trust anchors configured for a zone, a response to a request for a\nrecord in that zone with a bad signature could cause named to crash.\n(CVE-2010-3762)\nIt was discovered that, in certain cases, named did not properly perform\nDNSSEC validation of an NS RRset for zones in the middle of a DNSKEY\nalgorithm rollover. This flaw could cause the validator to incorrectly\ndetermine that the zone is insecure and not protected by DNSSEC.\n(CVE-2010-3614)\nAll BIND users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the\nupdate, the BIND daemon (named) will be restarted automatically.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
