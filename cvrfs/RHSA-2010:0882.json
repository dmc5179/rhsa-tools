Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.","The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n* An array index error was found in the gdth driver in the Linux kernel. A\nlocal user could send a specially-crafted IOCTL request that would cause a\ndenial of service or, possibly, privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3080,\nImportant)\n* NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in the r128 driver in the Linux\nkernel. Checks to test if the Concurrent Command Engine state was\ninitialized were missing in private IOCTL functions. An attacker could use\nthese flaws to cause a local denial of service or escalate their\nprivileges. (CVE-2009-3620, Important)\n* A flaw was found in the Intel PRO/1000 Linux driver, e1000, in the Linux\nkernel. A remote attacker using packets larger than the MTU could bypass\nthe existing fragment check, resulting in partial, invalid frames being\npassed to the network stack. This flaw could also possibly be used to\ntrigger a remote denial of service. (CVE-2009-4536, Important)\n* A use-after-free flaw was found in the tcp_rcv_state_process() function\nin the Linux kernel TCP/IP protocol suite implementation. If a system using\nIPv6 had the IPV6_PKTINFO option set on a listening socket, a remote\nattacker could send an IPv6 packet to that system, causing a kernel panic\n(denial of service). (CVE-2010-1188, Important)\n* When an application has a stack overflow, the stack could silently\noverwrite another memory mapped area instead of a segmentation fault\noccurring, which could cause an application to execute arbitrary code,\npossibly leading to privilege escalation. It is known that the X Window\nSystem server can be used to trigger this flaw. (CVE-2010-2240, Important)\n* The compat_alloc_user_space() function in the Linux kernel 32/64-bit\ncompatibility layer implementation was missing sanity checks. This function\ncould be abused in other areas of the Linux kernel. On 64-bit systems, a\nlocal, unprivileged user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges.\n(CVE-2010-3081, Important)\nRed Hat would like to thank the X.Org security team for reporting the\nCVE-2010-2240 issue, with upstream acknowledging Rafal Wojtczuk as the\noriginal reporter; and Ben Hawkes for reporting the CVE-2010-3081 issue.\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n* The RHSA-2009:1550 kernel update introduced a regression that prevented\ncertain custom kernel modules from loading, failing with \"unresolved\nsymbol\" errors. This update corrects this issue, allowing the affected\nmodules to load as expected. (BZ#556909)\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
