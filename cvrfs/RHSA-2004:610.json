It\nprovides the basic low level functionality which full fledged graphical\nuser interfaces (GUIs), such as GNOME and KDE are designed upon.\nSeveral integer overflow flaws in the X.Org libXpm library used to decode\nXPM (X PixMap) images have been found and addressed. An attacker could\ncreate a carefully crafted XP file which would cause an application to\ncrash or potentially execute arbitrary code if opened by a victim.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2004-0914 to this issue.\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain\nbackported security patches and other bug fixes.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
