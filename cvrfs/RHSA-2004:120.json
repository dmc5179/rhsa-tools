A remote attacker could\nperform a carefully crafted SSL/TLS handshake against a server that uses\nthe OpenSSL library in such a way as to cause OpenSSL to crash. Depending\non the application this could lead to a denial of service.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0079 to this issue.\nStephen Henson discovered a flaw in SSL/TLS handshaking code when using\nKerberos ciphersuites in OpenSSL 0.9.7a-0.9.7c.  A remote attacker could\nperform a carefully crafted SSL/TLS handshake against a server configured\nto use Kerberos ciphersuites in such a way as to cause OpenSSL to crash. \nMost applications have no ability to use Kerberos ciphersuites and will\ntherefore be unaffected by this issue.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0112 to\nthis issue.\nTesting performed by the OpenSSL group using the Codenomicon TLS Test Tool\nuncovered a bug in older versions of OpenSSL 0.9.6 prior to 0.9.6d that may\nlead to a denial of service attack (infinite loop).  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0081 to this issue.  This issue affects only the OpenSSL\ncompatibility packages shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.\nThese updated packages contain patches provided by the OpenSSL group that\nprotect against these issues.\nAdditionally, the version of libica included in the OpenSSL packages has\nbeen updated to 1.3.5. This only affects IBM s390 and IBM eServer zSeries\ncustomers and is required for the latest openCryptoki packages.\nNOTE: Because server applications are affected by this issue, users are\nadvised to either restart all services that use OpenSSL functionality or\nrestart their systems after installing these updates.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
