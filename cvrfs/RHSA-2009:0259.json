If mod_auth_mysql was configured to use a\nmultibyte character set that allowed a backslash '\\' as part of the\ncharacter encodings, a remote attacker could inject arbitrary SQL commands\ninto a login request. (CVE-2008-2384)\nNote: This flaw only affected non-default installations where \nAuthMySQLCharacterSet is configured to use one of the affected multibyte\ncharacter sets. Installations that did not use the AuthMySQLCharacterSet\nconfiguration option were not vulnerable to this flaw.\nAll mod_auth_mysql users are advised to upgrade to the updated package,\nwhich contains a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing\nthe update, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the fix to take effect.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
