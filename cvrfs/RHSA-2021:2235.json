It also looks like the installer is passing the\npassword as an insecure command line argument. The credentials are the\n389-DS LDAP server's Directory Manager credentials. The Directory\nManager is 389-DS' equivalent of unrestricted root account. The user\nbypasses permission checks and grants full access to data. In an IdM /\nFreeIPA installation the DM user is able to read and manipulate Kerberos\nKDC master password, Kerberos keytabs, hashed user passwords, and more.\nAny and all IdM and FreeIPA installations with PKI 10.10 should be\nconsidered compromised.\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.","This content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
